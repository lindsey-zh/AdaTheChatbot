My ex attempted suicide,"I got way too attached and when she ghosted me I wanted to hate her, but I couldnâ€™t. So I hated myself. At one point the only thing holding me back was the thought of living if I failed. 
Fast forward a year out of no where she attempts suicide. It made me realize how much I still cared about her. I donâ€™t feel like I deserve to be as broken down as I am though. I cared so much about her and she probably didnâ€™t even think of me for a moment. I was just another stupid dude to her. Everything about it is fueling my self hatred.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdibnn/my_ex_attempted_suicide/

Everything's been so hard after the psych ward.,"Throwaway, because all my friends and such know my account. I know they care, and that's what hurts me the most.

My head has always been a conflicting cloud of thoughts.

I keep thinking if I were to die, maybe everybody would be happier. Maybe I'll stop being such a fuck up. Maybe everybody would think of me as this better version of myself after I'm gone.

I'm young, and I know there's so much ahead for me, that maybe one day things will get better. But it's been so incredibly hard, and I don't think I can do it anymore. My stay at the psych ward made me behind in school, it made me feel selfish for wanting to work on myself, that I was causing pain for others.

I sometimes think that maybe if I was gone, people wouldn't need to worry anymore.

I wouldn't need to go chat to certain people to feel better.

I wouldn't stay in bed and cry all day about how much I just want to disappear.

I've been thinking about hanging myself, but after reading about how much it gets fucked up, I'm starting to think of a different method.

I don't know.

I just feel as if today is going to be my last.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdi767/everythings_been_so_hard_after_the_psych_ward/
When people see weakness they exploit it.,"If you're fuvked up in the head at this point which I'm assuming you are enough, such that even if you want to, your body does not do as you want it to. You want to run but it doesn't move, you want to scream and shout for help but are to afraid to, you try not to look like your eyes are gonna pop out from your skull any minute and you try to control your fast breathing and trembling voice when you're trying to seem unaffected by the things that remind you of your trauma But it doesn't obey you. Your body is as though it doesn't care that they look exposed and scared and weak in the eyes of those who want to harm it. And these people enjoy it, the pain your in and inflict more onto you for their own amusement. It's sickening, this world we live in with these monsters called humans. Donkeys are used as a degrading term but they are far better then us in regards to empathy, love and care.

Am I a bad person?,"My Step-Grandmother, who has been extremely abusive and toxic to myself and my Mother all of our lives got diagnosed with cancer last year. Itâ€™s not terminal at this time. However, she has required us to dedicate much of our time to her. She no longer has a car for whatever reason so I am forced to drive her around all day, everyday. My Mother has to grocery shop for her constantly and buy her food constantly. She is still extremely abusive and no matter how much I help out, she still abuses me and itâ€™s never enough. She resents my Grandfather for passing away earlier in his life even though he died in his sleep of a heart attack. Before he passed she was still extremely abusive. But itâ€™s now at an all time high because of her condition. Does it make me a bad person for wanting her to die so we can finally be at peace?

I'm just so tired.,"It's 4 am for me. Stuck alone in my room with my thoughts and I don't know why I'm even posting about any of this but I just have no one to turn too.

A little background information about me to help paint a picture. I'm 21 and gay and I am depressed, alone, filled with anxiety, and extremely suicidal. There really hasn't been a day that has gone by where I don't think about killing myself, negative thoughts about myself, just bursting into tears alone in my room or just in public.

The pain that I am feeling is completely unbearable, I'm just so tired of even living and moving forward in this life when I just don't think worth it. My whole life I just have been faced with pain and pain and pain again and I just keep trying and I'm just so tired. I'm tired of this life. Tired of the pain and just tired with myself.

I have come to the realization that no matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, or how hard I try to become someone else. I just will never be good enough, that has always been what my life has been about. I don't even know who I am anymore, I look in the mirror and I just don't recognize who I am anymore let alone know who I am anymore. Sounds weird, I know. It's just I was never happy with who I was as a person and that always fucked me up then I try being other people and that always fucked me up so I just never win. It's just so fucking disheartening and gruesome to just always be put back in this hellish place of just never being enough, uglyness, trying so hard and getting fucked and this whole stupid ass existence.

I just don't see a future anymore. I don't want to see tomorrow anymore. I'm constantly wishing for death. Hoping I get run over by a car, get in an accident, OD on anything. Just something that will take this pain away.

I have been feeling this way for years and years and I just never seem to get a break, not even for a single moment. I am always brought back here. This is all I never know. I don't deserve love or happiness or even a glimpse of joy. I'm always there for others and I try my best to be supportive to show my love and care but when it come's to me I just don't get it.

I'm ready to go. I say that every day and yet I'm still here.... I don't know why that is though. But at the same time I just feel like i'm one step closer to pushing the trigger and ending it all. Sorry for my foolishness. I probably will delete. But hey if I ever end up doing it, my thoughts will be here.

Please remember this,"Okay, let me tell you something. This is not out of the blue or anything. This is from my experience as well others.
When someone attempts suicide or seems to show suicidal traits, you are not supposed to hit them with aggressive sentences like ""Are you crazy? What the fuck is wrong with you?"" and insensitive sentences like ""Maybe, try this, it will help you die easily"" or ""Suicide is for the cowards"".
For a moment, take a step back and stand in their shoes. Try to understand, why they took such a big step. Ask questions like ""Are you feeling fine?"" ""Are you okay?"" ""Do you wanna talk about it?"" and ""I'm always here"".
That's the sign of an emotionally mature person who knows what to say when.
Do not also try to justify their actions by comparing your pain to theirs. Their journey, their struggles, their hurt are absolutely different from yours. Their tolerance level is different. You're not doing any good by constantly showering comparisons in disguise of advices.
Be considerate, be kind and approach such people gently. So many of you have to learn this that it deeply saddens me.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fd8d4y/please_remember_this/
I hate encouragement,"(Disclaimer that I get suicidal ideation in a more ongoing ""casual"" form, so might not resonate with everyone.)

What I would give for someone to say, ""I understand you're struggling, and I will understand if you choose to end it.""

Even my friends who get suicidal ideation come from a perspective of it being something you'll get through. They talk about how meds have helped them. Or about how they've become more resilient. And they'll say they'll help and encourage you the whole way.

But I don't want someone to encourage me. I want someone to sit with me and say, ""Yeah that really sucks."" To say, ""It's okay if you can't handle it."" Or even, ""I'll help you end the pain.""

I wouldn't do anything, would never take them up on it. But it would be so incredibly validating. 

I want to be heard; I want to be understood. I'm on meds, I'm in therapy, I'm resilient. I know I'm doing all the right things. Just please stop telling me I'm going to be okay, and listen to me when I say I'm not.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fd46vq/i_hate_encouragement/

I don't know what to do.,"I'm 28m, I moved back in with my parents when my house was sold out from under me.  I've been slowly deteriorating.  I've considered suicide since I was in middleschool.  And attempted sometimes halfheartedly, a handful of times.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel empty.  Like I don't belong.  I have been single for the last 6 years.  Not counting short relationships.  I haven't gone to college.  I have no desire to continue living.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was younger suicide was a strong but fleeting feeling.  It would hit me like a train but if I held on for long enough it would disappear like a light being switched off.  As I grow older it seems that those feelings that before were quick, are no constant.  Suicide is almost always on my mind.  And my determination to succeed seems to have strengthened.  


I have very little to complain about in life.  I have a job, I'm saving money.  I have some fantastic friends, and I live in a beautiful part of the world.  


I am alone though.  Every attempt I've made at having a relationship with a woman has failed.  Not always because of me.  But the feeling of being empty and alone is unbearable.  Partnership is hardwired into our dna and I seem to have been born into the perfect brain for avoiding it.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to do.  I want to end it.  I'm worried what it might do to my parents.  They are already on the  edge of a divorce that I believe has been coming since I was very young.  They have already shown themselves to be fairly incapable when it comes to helping me with my mental issues.  They knew I had ADD as a child but did nothing about it.  Hoping it would go away.  They've taken me to therapy for my depression, but I find it difficult to be honest about my feelings when I'm face to face with someone.  Because the few times I have been, it has lead to a response consisting of distance, and alienation, not compassion or empathy.  And even more often the simple words ""suck it up"".

&amp;#x200B;

I'm fairly sure I'll die by suicide.  Likely within the next few years.  My only goal is to try and patch up my relationships with family and loved ones so that  I can send myself off with the least amount of guilt possible.  I don't want to tear peoples lives apart.  I just wish I had never been born.  I don't feel lovable.  I don't feel as if I can really trust anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

Never had someone compliment me. Never had an unforgettable holiday trip. Never had a memorable spring break or summer break. Never went to a cool festival. Never had a great party. Never hosted one either. The list goes on and on and on. I feel lonely and my depression is physically weighing down on me. I have no motivation to do anything any more and my parents say they can read that off my face. 

I legit cannot remember the last time I had fun. Why would I even bother going on like this when I feel like I am just surviving each day rather than living. I am almost tempted to move to another country, start anew, and just go entirely crazy, but I feel like I would carry on the same way and be even more depressed.

I don't know who to talk to anymore...,"When I was around 6-7 y.o my dad got a scholarship in Australia. I was really happy to be there. I was someone who had lots of friends, exceptional grades, etc. But that turned 180Â° once I came back from Australia to my home country..I just don't know why.

Junior high was pretty average execpt my grades were starting to fall and I got the occasional teasing because I had a 'different' English accent. Then come high school when everything hit real hard. 

My grades were below par, my dad didn't allow me to hang out with friends, he started being a heli parent and would make irrational night curfews. I also got into numerous trouble with school. 

Over time, what I thought were my friends left me one by one. They even spread a rumor that I was gay (a big no in my country). And to top it off, my girlfriend cheated on me. I felt so desolate and unwanted. Ever since that I became socially awkward and has started to stutter/mumble in my speech. I thought about jumping off a roof but canceled

Eventually I just ate my depression and loneliness while at the same time gaining 10 kilos off it making me obese.

Last year I got accepted to uni in a city away from home. It gave me my much needed liberty away from my dad. I tried making friends, did the usual stuff but was shrugged off being not 'cool' enough or was just a plain awkward person. It kills me looking people left and right are with their friends or s.o being happy while there I am walking by myself alone to sit in class alone again.

Being in uni also made my mind grow wild. I've thought of many different ways of how ordinary objects can be used to kill me. I've tried swerving my motorbike onto an oncoming 18 wheeler but was too scared. I also bought a rope..a decision to use it thats been back and forth.

I hate those damn Ubiquitous Suicide Hotline Posters.,"People need to realise and understand just how much bullshit suicide prevention is.

Because Yes, lets put posters to the suicide hotline a bit everywhere, look, we're only helping!

The suicide hotline! yes ! of course! why didn't I think of that?

All those things are there to make other people happy and fool them into thinking ""They're doing a great job helping!""  
You're really not.

How about this one? Force them to seek counselling  
Ah yes! Because talking about how I feel is going to make my problems go away! Of course  
Well, you'll get tools to /cope/ with those things, see -  
Oh! but it won't resolve any of the underlying issues, I see, you're only treating the symptoms of flesh eating  disease.

Institutionalisation?  
Well, how about fuck you Sheryl. Because isolating me even more really is going to help.  
But YOU can rest assured that /you did everything you could/! Look! the problem is no longer visible to you!
So therefore it must be working!   
Pat yourself on the shoulder, you did a great job!   
That person surely isn't going to fold into themselves even more than they already have
as they just sit around looking at blank walls, waiting for there next therapy session with doctors that are too rushed

It's like facing the corner for ""adults"". Think nice and hard about what you did! See you in three weeks!  

Well, how about numbing him AND therapy?   
Listen Maribeth, why do you think that's going to work? Because there's an entire industry around it?   
That must mean it HAS to be successful! Everyone! Everytime! Guaranteed!  
Surely it can ONLY /help/ those poor depressed souls, because the good doctor and the books say that it works
Surely their one follow-up call to re-make an appointment will change everything when they failed to show up  
Well, they didn't want to be here, on to someone that actually WANTS to be helped  
And the cycle... continues  

Surely taking pills to numb me to force me to sit in emotional comatose will   
Cure me of my autoimmune disease that will end me prematurally anyways  
Find me nice stable jobs that can work around my frequent and random stays at the hospital  
Stop jobs from firing me for invalid reasons because of it  
And extinguish an innumerable amount of very real fires in my life that set me down this path in the first place

can't people see why it doesn't work? why I push people away  
Even though I really really REALLY don't want to  
And it only hurts me even more  
permanently scaring the relationships that matter most to me  
never able to go back to how things were before  
inevitably helping me push myself to take the final jump  
when there is no one left around me  
when they all finally shut me out  
and none of them bother to reach out or care anymore  
or know that I finally jumped  

I feel stuck, Like an atom stuck on a plateau, trying to Fuse   
the only way to unlock my potential energy would be through quantum tunneling   
But you need to put outside energy in the system for it to work  
The only power that does work, is a firm grasping hand from ones we love the most,  
holding on with all their might despite the weight trying to sink ever deeper  
And the mightiest of tugs, going through that hill  
Holding on, as hard as they can, as they careen down the quantum waterfall in a burst of energy

"Thanks dad, you really helped. You're a genius.

Wow. Genius, dad. I just need to stop FEELING and study my ass off. It makes so much sense. Why didn't I think of that?

And mom, I guess hating your child for being broken by your abuse is logical too! I  mean, how dare I make you feel bad by crying and trying to hang myself after you shook me and screamed in my face and told me I was no longer in the family?

I'd like to tag her reddit account but am unsure if that breaks any rules. I believe the only reason she is holding back is fear of what would happen to our 1year old son. She has attempted before in the past before we were married.

 Saying the last few months has been unkind to my family is a severe understatement. Lost my job and couldn't find work for several months that eventually led to our recent eviction. As a result, I've been forced to return to long haul truck driving so I am unable to physically be there for her while she stays at her extremely mentally abusive parents home. I've managed to secure her a better place to stay with a friend of mine and even a place for our dog, but thats the limit of what I can do. I'm bad at feelings, but I'm a good listener, and I am completely lost how to handle the situation. She wants to run away and feels as though she drowning. That nobody cares or doesn't want to notice. I am afraid she came forward to me today because she is getting ready to follow through, and I'm over a thousand miles away with no way home and *completely* out of my depth.

For those of you who monitor these posts to give advice, Iâ€™d really appreciate some right about now. I just donâ€™t know how to control these urges anymore. 

I have a bad tendency to use alcohol to numb these feelings and thoughts. I know itâ€™s not a good method. But itâ€™s one thatâ€™s worked for me in the past.

What has worked for you in the past? How do you feel better when youâ€™ve been beaten into submission again? What do you do? How do you distract yourself? How do you avoid these dark tendencies?

My first post,"I have been diagnosed with major depression and anxiety years ago. Hi, I'm a 41 year old male with a good job, make good money, why should I be hurting? Depression, anxiety and suicide runs in my family. I have been committed to a 72 hour hold twice for being suicidal and planning my suicide. I do self harm. I think about suicide weekly, sometimes daily. I don't want medication but I self medicate with alcohol, work obsession or high risk sports. I'm embarrassed because I can't fit in with life, I'm broken with no fix. I suffer in silence as I don't want to bother my family, friends and girlfriend. I have planned my suicide many times, even tonight. Yes, I have written many suicide notes as well.

If I tell someone, they lock me up without shoelaces. This is not what I need, this causes me to hide it even more. I'm broken with no fix. I already go through cycles of being numb, angry, and sad. I don't want to feel numb from medication (I've been there before, what is the purpose.). I don't trust anyone to talk about this with, they respond with ways that make me hide my what I truly feel.

I want this pain to stop, the pain I've been feeling for years. Why am I broken? Besides not waking up, I don't know what else is the answer. I understand why my family member committed suicide, I get it, it isn't selfish, it is to stop the pain that many can't understand.

I don't know what to do. Do I end it, hide in silence and keep everyone happy, or say something and be even more miserable and in turn become more numb? Who really cares? I know alcohol doesn't help, but it helps me sleep, or if I don't drink here I am wide awake trying to make my brain quiet. I do high risk sports, secretly hoping that I will die.

I spent last night at the emergency room alone, I didn't contact my family, friends and erased a message for my girlfriend (I wasn't sure if it was a heart attack and didn't want to die alone but didn't want to bother anyone). My girlfriend saw some erased messages, so I told my girlfriend that it was some chest pain I wanted to make sure wasn't anything, I never told my family or friends and never will.

I don't know what to do, I need this to stop. This is my cycle, I'm numb or angry at everyone and push everyone way. If I wake up tomorrow, I will think whoever wrote this is an idiot and stupid, numb and ignorant to the pain I feel. Cycle repeats.

It more than often seems that I am just a burden that they are carrying, and until everything is right with me, they are right, when something goes wrong with me and I need their help, they take up arms against me. I am very tired of all this. I am tired of this life. I don't want to live any more. There is absolutely no joy in my life, just pretence. Every smile is a pretence, every laugh is a sham trying to hide the screams I am screaming inside. And it has been going on for years now. I am so tired. If I were numb, I could have lived through any pain for a long long time, but unfortunately I am sensitive as fuck. I don't know how not to get affected by my mind. I don't know how not to get affected by all the rubbish overthinking that I do. It is all my fault. All my fault. I am a crack. I don't fit here amidst all these perfection, who just can't take my imperfection. I am so tired Maa. Come take me. I want to go back to you. I have had enough with this world. It has been such a long time since the warmth of your void. There was no pain. Nothing to cry the whole night about. No night. No day. Nothing. I was just nothing like you Maa. Why did I have to come here? I couldn't have asked for a life like this, where my own mind becomes my enemy, and I sit like a mute observer, unable to change anything. Just watching and suffering every consequences on this body which won't even be with me when I leave. Why do I suffer so much? What have I done to deserve so much pain? Have I given someone this much pain in life? Maybe I have. And maybe it is all coming back to me. So I beg you, whoever you are that makes all things go.. give it all to me once. Give all of whatever pain you have kept for me, all at once. And release me from this shell. I do not want it any more. I have no use for such an existence. Take me back to the nothing that I always was. I want to die Maa. I've had it enough.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fdbwbz/so_long_and_thanks_for_all_the_fish/
"Life is going nowhere, canâ€™t walk, feel like a huge disappoitment and a burden.","Hey Reddit. Iâ€™ve been debating posting on here for a while but Iâ€™m having more suicidal thoughts than ever before and I just need to get this all of my chest. Iâ€™m 32, male. I have an amazing girlfriend who is way out of my league and a fun job I enjoy and yet, here I am. 

Despite having some really good parts of my life, Iâ€™m slammed by thoughts of being worthless and just living a pointless existence. Iâ€™m in debt up to my eyeballs and my credit is trashed. I feel like despite getting a $15,000 raise at work, Iâ€™m still nowhere near where I want to be at this point in my life. I feel like I have no tangible future and am just waiting to die one day. In the past 4 years Iâ€™ve lost my father and my grandmother, two of the most influential people in my life. Iâ€™m in the process of moving but am having a difficult time finding good apartments because of my credit so Ive been forced to stay with my mom until Iâ€™m settled. I travel for my job and my car is falling apart but I donâ€™t have good replacement options again because of the credit issue. Iâ€™m ridden with anxiety about everything and fear of future issues prevents me from enjoying the now. To top it all off, I was visiting my girlfriend this weekend who lives a few hours away from me and I severely inured my knee and I canâ€™t walk. I have to find a surgeon and probably have an operation and she wants to take care of me hand and foot but it just makes me feel like Iâ€™m a giant burden. Sheâ€™s so amazing and I feel like I donâ€™t offer anything financially and am just a 32 dependent who, as of right now can barely make it to the bathroom because of this damn leg. 

I am an atheist. I donâ€™t believe in any form of an afterlife as I just canâ€™t accept something with no evidence. I firmly believe in my heart that my grandmother and father are gone. Aside from their graves nothing remains of them and they are not in another realm enjoying themselves. All that exists for then is the black void of nothingness. And despite so many rays of sunshine in my dark life, I feel so envious of them. To not have to feel this anxiety and pain anymore is such an appealing feeling to me. This world is such a terrible place where ignorance and hate have run so rampant and people take such joy in hurting their fellow man. What future can society have with a foundation like this? I find myself thinking about ending everything on a near daily basis. I see lots of redditors posting here about how they are excited for some kind of afterlife because they canâ€™t accept that this is the best we can do. But for me, an absence of anything would be as good as the existence of a heaven. 

I feel better having laid all this out in text but I still find myself objectively weighing the pros and cons of ending my life. So I donâ€™t know what I was hoping for by posting this. Maybe I need someone to talk me off the ledge... who knows. But in all honestly, leaping from the ledge looks better and bettter with each passing minute...",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fd9umt/life_is_going_nowhere_cant_walk_feel_like_a_huge/

It took me attempting suicide to realise that I was right about nobody caring if I died.,"So last week everything got to me.

I've lost my son, wife, car, my home even and haven't eaten in 5 days as I have nothing to my name. Living off nothing but tap water for substance. I'm week and ill due to this.

My parents won't help, they say I'm a wimp for attempting.

My father said I was worthless and amount to nothing before offering to kick my face in for being a ""puff"" (rich as he's never worked in my entire life a day and mum's always provided for him while I've worked abroad, owned a home and much more but yeah).

My friends avoid me and don't want to hang around me, o only have a place to sleep thanks to my mother, but it's a rock hard floor and my father won't let me stay, eat or do anything there so in the day I'm cut lose to wonder the streets in the rain and cold. A problem as we've had a lot of major storms and even flooding here recently.

So last week I went to the lake I frequented as a child and hung myself. That was meant to be it. But in typical pathetic fashion I failed here too. The rope snapped.

I woke up a few minutes later, dizzy from the fall, unsure where I was due to the lack of oxygen. Eventually I recovered and went back to my parents to sleep. Wet, drenched, in pain and hungry. The next morning the abuse from my father began.

I'm 24 and I have nothing, only a few months ago I had everything and a newborn son. My ex wife took all that, took him thousands of miles away. I miss him more than anything.

But nobody cares I'm hungry, cold, alone. Nobody even cares I attempted suicide.

Not a single friend wants to spend time with me. My family hates me. My son isn't there to comfort me.

All I can take pride in now is my ability to end everything again soon, to finally have this all over, and this time I won't fail hopefully.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fd38v7/it_took_me_attempting_suicide_to_realise_that_i/

I think that going back to uni (in a course that requires I have bare arms for practicals/placements) and having people see my recent self harm scarring is going to be the final straw that pushes me over the edge.

"It comes in waves, but Iâ€™m really feeling it this time.","I have been dealing with depression since my mid-teens. It comes in waves. I go from a deep depression to a more mild feeling, but itâ€™s always there. As I got older, the low tide began to stick around longer than the high tide. I have tried numerous prescriptions with no result, and no other form of therapy has caused the slightest change in the way I feel.

For the past year, I have lost all enjoyment in every aspect of my life. Usually this passes but this is the longest stretch Iâ€™ve had. Itâ€™s almost like Iâ€™ve come to some sort of acceptance that this is how Iâ€™m going to feel forever if I donâ€™t end it.

The current climate of the world (I donâ€™t mean Global Warming) has also pushed me the closest Iâ€™ve ever been to ending it. I used to enjoy movies, music, television and video games as a form of escape. I canâ€™t enjoy them anymore. The hyper-politicalization of EVERYTHING has corroded away the enjoyment I received from the few things I used as an escape.

I am very good at hiding my feelings, and nobody knows about my thoughts and plans for suicide. My friends and coworkers all know me as an easy going, relaxed guy. I also donâ€™t want them to know, so itâ€™s a full time job on top of my job to keep it up, and itâ€™s exhausting.

I made plans on how I would do it during my last low point, and Iâ€™m closer now than ever. I have all the means to pull it off, I just have to do it. 

Iâ€™m also not sure why I posted this. Maybe a way to flesh out a suicide note. Iâ€™ve been on reddit for years, but never posted.

SARS-CoV2,"Is it bad that I kind of want to just catch the virus already? I have a lot of health conditions and if I die from the virus, oh well it was tragic. Just get it over with. My odds of getting it are pretty high anyway, seeing that I live in the epicenter of the US outbreak and have to go out in public for work. 

Iâ€™m already a burden to everyone around me. Iâ€™m an inconvenience and my pain is over dramatic. I donâ€™t have the right to complain and donâ€™t want to annoy those around me by saying anything or accidentally letting on that something is up. The way I feel is disproportionate to the severity of my problems and I should be over it. Dying by COVID-19 would solve that, honestly. I donâ€™t really want to die, especially not from suffocation and pneumonia, but it feels inevitable right now.

Suicide or be abused?,"It just feels like life is a stack of endless abuse and trauma from being born. I would prefer not to spend my life friendless, alone, and bullied or abused for what seems like just being alive. And Iâ€™m sick of explaining whatâ€™s going on. No one is helpful and ppl think their lives and perspectives and view points are the only ones that seem to exists. Life is truly miserable I canâ€™t even get out of bed anymore. I use to want to fight to be a musician. For what? To continue being abused and mistreated? Fucking hell where does this shit end.


I guess the real question is how do people find ways to live for something they donâ€™t mind being abused for. Something that is more gratifying than actually suffering. For me it is making music and sharing it. Thatâ€™s all. If I donâ€™t blossom as an artists I canâ€™t see any other way to make the pain worth fighting on for. I really need to focus on my music even if It kills me trying to reach my goals. What else is there for me to be alive for. I hate being abused and hate most things in life. Having a mediocre job isnâ€™t worth being mistreated for. I have to die trying to do something from my wildest dreams or I will pull my plug. Iâ€™m just talking about myself. If you find joy in something I donâ€™t then that is great. Whatever keeps ppl alive.

just alone and confused,"In October, I was assaulted by my then ex-boyfriend. Even though we had broken up in August,  I had reached out to him because he was one of the few people who knew that it was the year anniversary of the first time I was assaulted. And then he raped me. 

Since then, nothing has been good for me. Iâ€™ve had to withdraw from the semester because Iâ€™ve been too depressed to go to any classes. My relationships are falling apart because Iâ€™m not acting like myself anymore and no one wants to be around me. Or maybe I just want to be alone, I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t sleep at night because I donâ€™t feel safe in my own bed after what happened. And I feel like thereâ€™s no one I can talk to about anything because theyâ€™re all sick of hearing about it. Even the people I know I can trust arenâ€™t options. If I told my mom or dad, theyâ€™d make me move back home, and that would just make things so much worse. My closest friends would try to push me to get hospitalized, which my family canâ€™t afford. I stopped seeing my therapist because I felt like whenever I tried to open up emotionally, she would change the subject. I donâ€™t know what to do or who to talk to anymore. 

Iâ€™ve wanted to kill myself before, and Iâ€™ve actually had several suicide attempts. Something about this time feels different. I know what I would do, and Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m more afraid that it would actually work this time, or afraid of the slight possibility I could still survive. I know I donâ€™t want to die, really, and that I just want the pain to stop. But thereâ€™s nothing I can do that makes anything feel easier anymore and I donâ€™t know if I have the energy to keep trying.

"It's not the depression, it's me","I mean yes never feeling happiness, always feeling tired, and all that other shit that comes with depression would've contributed to this, but I think I'm just using depression as an excuse to hide the fact that I'm a terrible person.

I've had depression since at least the age of 10. I'm 17 now and until about a year or two ago my depression was never a huge problem. I was passing school, I had friends and I had hobbies. But one day after my suicide attempt I got a random boost in motivation, and I felt happiness for the first time in years. Feeling happiness only made me realize how miserable I am all the time, which led to me figuring out that I have depression.

Ever since I became aware of this, I started doing things like, failing school, ghosting friends, and dropping out of hobbies. Whenever I smile or laugh, I hide it and try my best to make myself sad. I fetishized my sadness, sadness was my happy place, and being happy was painful for me. I feel like I'm just putting on a play for myself to hide the fact that I'm just a selfish ass, who does nothing but play videogames all day. Now here's a good confession, I don't have a suicide attempt, yeah when the the day came I was to lazy to get out of bed and walk to the railway so I just didn't. Yet everyone I've told my story to has heard me talk about my suicide attempt, I told myself this so much that I actually forgot I never even tried for a while, but it's all a lie, just an excuse to make me look more broken then I already am. Some days I think of actually going there, and reenacting that moment to see if I'll actually do it or not, but I'm to lazy to get out of bed so as if I'd do that.

I fear that my therapist will find out. That if I get cured from my depression that I'm still going to be just as shitty as always and that it was just me all along. If that's true then that means there's no curing me, and that I'm just going to be like this forever.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fd5mg3/its_not_the_depression_its_me/

Attempted Suicide...,"Growing up, people always tell me that I will be somebody and I can be whoever I wanna be if I put my mind into it, 10 years passed turns out I'm a nobody with no motivation to live.

Looking back, I wanna hug my old self and tell him to cherish every moment of being a young kid because the world is a harsh place to everyone and you'll also be a victim of society.

I'm nothing, worthless, and nobody. If I die nothing would happen... The world around me would still be the same...

People die every day, so what would make it different if I disappear? NOTHING! I decided to hang myself in the bathroom.

I cried with pain and satisfaction that I will be leaving this earth then the shower curtain rod in my bathroom broke...

It was a loud thud but luckily everyone's asleep... I proceeded to cry in silence and thinking about what should I do? 

I'm ugly, worthless, piece of crap, and a waste of oxygen... My acne scars make me feel like I'm nothing... Everything about me is SHIT.

2/16/20,"on the morning of February 16 2020 i took my cat to the emergency vet to have her checked out. she was extremely skinny and was not moving and hadnt eaten or used the bathroom in 2 days. she barely wanted to be around anyone and her muscules were so weak she couldnt even use her back legs or stand. she would just drag herself to where she wanted to go then lay down exhausted. i thought she was going to die the night before but miraculously she survived but was still extremely weak and exhausted looking.

i put her in her pet cage and drove to the emergency vet. the vet examined her and immediately became accusatory and critical of me and how my kitty got into the position that she was in, asking me every question under the sun what did i give her to eat? whats her past medical history? and maybe about 40 other questions.  even calling my cat a train wreck. she was in horrible condition and he kept telling me things such as ""well if you wouldve taken her to your regular vet and had checkups sooner, all of this couldve been prevented"" ""you should've given her her medicine. hyperthyroidism is manageable and bc you didnt do this and that your cat is in the condition that shes in""   which just made me feel so damn guilty. i wanted to take her away right then and there. he then tells me that he couldnt feel her liver and that she only had 25% of her kidneys working and that she was extremely dehydrated.

he mentioned giving her medicine and iv drips and changing her diet but because of the state she was in, he said it wouldn't do much at all at this point because her kidneys would eventually fail. so then he suggests euthanasia. and my heart dropped like a rock. i didnt want to do it. i wanted to give her the medicine i was hell bent on it. ill pay it now, i dont care what the price is ill pay it now! but he kept pushing me and my sister to sign up for a credit plan to pay for it because he simply ""didnt want to be the bank"" he even said that we could give her all of the medicine and change her diet etc and theres a possibility that it still wont work at all because of how debilitated she was. 

eventually our family made the decision to have her put to sleep on the same day as the visit. we had a previous cat who passed away due to kidney failure and we didnt want her to go through the same thing. we all snuggled her, kissed her and pet her until she breathed her final breath on the table. it was heart wrenching. we didnt want to bring her home because we all live with out 80 year old grandmother who prior to having her put to sleep, my grandmother would see her dragging her legs and see how weak and exhausted she looked and would start crying and saying how she didnt want to see the cat suffer like that anymore.  we didnt want to bring her home because we didnt want anything to happen to grandma so  we had everything done in one day and it all happened so fast. im still torn about it. i feel like i can go back in time and pull her away from the table, and bring her to present day. 

i miss you so much misty,  my little baby. it felt like we all yanked you out of this world too soon and thats what drives me crazy. the regular vet i tookher to long ago when we first found out about it told us all that she had hyperthyroidism. all 3 of us were in charge of making sure she got her medicine until she finished it, and then it dwindled down to just me having the responsibility. i was in a very stressed out mindset between my shit job with no set hours,  and  taking care of my grandmother who has dementia.we have to make sure she dosent wander outside or anything. and had completely forgotten/ was counting on other family members to give her her medicine because i was not home. i had forgotten that she even took  medicine at all because she was doing so well. she was eating, and playing until about last year when i went to have her ears checked. thats when they reminded me. and it all went downhill. 

so again i gave her her medicine and she  finished it. only to find out this year she would have to be put to sleep. i never intended to hurt you misty, i never wanted you to get so sick. every morning i cry my eyes out wishing you were here with me on my bed or licking my hand or even meowing that cute little ""hello"" meow you used to do. every day i think about the what ifs and the if onlys. i cant even smell or look at certain things anymore, i cant smile or be happy anymore without my baby. 
i bought a box cutter last week because i was seriously contemplating ending my own life because of the horrible guilt. i feel like i murdered that cat. i feel like i purposefully let her get sick and die . i felt like she didnt need to be euthanized. it was my responsibility to make sure you got your medicine and i fucked up so bad. i dont want to live anymore feeling like this. im so sorry my sweet baby kitty.   how can i help my grandmother if i failed to help you? i feel like im the only one in the world dealing with this situation. i  know im not, but i just want to fucking die. i hate existing. everyday i wake up im reminded that my cat is gone. my best friend, my baby is dead and i caused it and i want to throw up. i hate living i want to die and just not feel anything im so sorry misty im so sorry",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fd25b3/2162020/
It's over and there is just nowhere else to go.,"I think this could be it. I'm really just not able to grasp this world. This is not where I want to be. 

People are just so fucked. It doesn't matter where they come from, what they do, or even really how they act. There is just an insufferable defect in humanity's existence. I am 100% for an extinction event. I'm no longer in a panic about climate change or anything like that, I want it to accelerate. I don't want to be here when shit hits the fan, but I want it to happen. I am now certain that we are incapable of a better future where these defects do not exist. The same story keeps playing out over and over again, the only difference is now it is playing out on smart phones. People are just fucked. 

People call me a failure and I laugh. The tragedy is that there is no glory in this world. You could win a million bucks in the stock market and you are still going down with the rest of us. We see the way that the most powerful people in the world act every day. Some idiot decided to give them all Twitter accounts. Oh my gosh, what a riot. It has got to the point where the weak are still the weak and the strong just look dumber than everyone else. 

Obviously this is not the kind of attitude that anyone would want to put up with so I should leave to avoid pissing anyone else off even though I am absolutely right. I like to tell myself that having a better attitude means accepting a wrong position for the sake of getting along with everyone else walking off the cliff. Well there are two options, I can be right and go crazy stranded alone outside the herd or I can be wrong and feel good about myself because I have people walking into the abyss with me. What a stupid, stupid fate. Well there is a third option, I could kill myself. 

I don't even want to hear some people have it worse. I'm sorry but hearing about 6 billion people who have it worse doesn't brighten my day. Try harder, try again. You're not going to make me feel any better by reminding me my country, my tax dollars contribute significantly to their peril by bombing many of those people into ruins for the sake of politicians and bureaucrats who have literally become Twitter trolls. It's not funny, I mean it. 

I want to kill myself. I have had it in my mind for a long time but there was something spiritually holding me here. I wonder if that has passed. I don't see anymore goal posts. I'm begging desperately for a sign because as much as I want it to stop I'm a coward who fears death. But the pressure comes sometimes so hard, so intense that I'm not thinking about fear or any of that. Those are the moments where I know it might happen. 

This post may get deleted for inciting activism but for me personally I do not care what you do or what your social positions are. We are all collectively collapsing, so I don't care who you vote for or what you believe. These are just the thoughts driving me toward alienation and inevitably perhaps death. I'm not even looking forward to a girlfriend anymore. I can only imagine waking up every day and telling her we are all doomed, or better yet lying to her face and saying everything is alright.

Advice on finally maybe starting to get help,"Hi everyone,

For the first time EVER I am going to speak to someone tomorrow about my suicidal ideation, which has plagued me for 10 years. 

I'm currently at uni, and booked an appointment with a student support officer from my school. She's not a counsellor, but can deal with academic issues (which I'm having because of the big sad), and refer students onto mental health services.

I'm absolutely shit scared. I've never really spoken to anyone about how I feel, only a couple of times drunkenly to a few friends (who've never brought it up again). I just feel like it's time because things have gotten worse recently, and I'll be graduating this summer which is terrifying. 

I'm not really sure where to start with the meeting, or about what I should say? I've never met her before, I just emailed to book a meeting.

Let me know if this is the wrong sub. I'm basically just wanting to know how to start the conversation and how much detail to go into. It feels way too intense to just sit down and be like hi nice to meet you I think about killing myself every day and have a pile of suicide notes on my desk. I also don't want to be sectioned lol.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fd51kc/advice_on_finally_maybe_starting_to_get_help/

I have no one to turn to.,"My father passed away last year. I feel incredibly alone now, he was my go-to person whenever I had a problem. I left my job to take some time off after he passed. I've left two more jobs since then, I just can't handle any of it any more. My gf, who I've been staying with, wants me to leave so she can ""find herself.""

I can't blame her really.

My father's gf, whom he was with at the time of his passing and for the previous 15 years or so, has already moved on and started dating a guy that I don't think dad would approve of, either.

I don't know who to turn to or what to do. I have a little bit of money saved up so I'm not in immediate danger, and I think I've worked it out with my gf to stay here until I find a job? I just don't hold out a ton of hope. Whenever I think of getting another job, most likely in a field I hate anyway (recruiting), I just think ""what's the point?"" Like I really don't have a ton to live for at this juncture. 

I don't want it to be this way and I just can't seem to figure a way out of it that would give me a good quality of life. It all just feels pointless.

"Just got diagnosed borderline, and trying on new meds, I need help","My first post ever on reddit. Im feeling so low right now, been crying all night, and I just want to get better, but nothing seems to work. During Christmas vacation, I realised my partner had been cheating on me, the night I founded out, he went to that girl house and had intercourse with her. He still came back to my place after and told me everything the next day. I completely lost it, It was the first time someone cheated on me. I felt betrayed, and couldnt wrap my head around it. My reaction was to drink as much alcool, smoke cigarette until I could forget what happen.. unfortunately that wasnt enough I was still feeling so much pain. I than decides to take a half empty bottle of xanax with a bottle of antidepressant. Just to wash the pain away, just like that I was doing my first suicide attempt.  20 minutes after I realised what I had done and called emergency, an ambulance came over and I spent 24 hours at psychiatry aisle. I started seeing a psychiatrist after that, and was diagnosed for borderline personality. For me it makes sense, but it seems close friend and family think its too much, that Im not borderline.. thing is Im really good at hiding my true self. Ive been boulimic for years without anyone ever knew I was. Ive been having intense rage and impulsive reaction when Im in love. 

Anyway.. lets come back to my story, I ended up staying with my partner, a decision that has been torturing me ever since. There is not a day that passes without me thinking he would so ut again. I will think about what happened imagining it until I start feeling sick, and than everything turns black again. I havent been easy with him after that, but how could I ? 

My psychiatrist just prescribed me a new drug to mix with my antidepressants and I started them yesterday, I hate all the side effect if taking a new drugs and I just feel like I want to give up. ive been having a lot of fights with my partner in the last days cause I dont find him supportive. I feel so alone right now, I tried to communicate with him but its just too much, I feel like a burden for him and its been breaking me even more.

Am I the only one who doesnâ€™t really care if Iâ€™m sent to the psych ward because I told my therapist too much?,"I donâ€™t really want to die, I want to stop being so fucked up. And if the best way to do that is to kill myself, thatâ€™s the route Iâ€™ll take. But that isnâ€™t the only route available, and if thereâ€™s a way for that to happen through medication or mental healthcare Iâ€™ll gladly choose that. But the problem is I donâ€™t really care if I live or die, so if that course of action is too difficult Iâ€™ll just take the easy way out and kill myself (I say easy because itâ€™ll be easy for me, but the main thing thatâ€™s preventing me from doing it is how other people will take it).

That being said, Iâ€™m not going to avoid saying something to my therapist because I think heâ€™ll send me to a psych ward. The best chance I have to get better through meds and therapy is to be honest with whatâ€™s going on, and Iâ€™m completely fine with that. I donâ€™t really have anything going on in my life I wouldnâ€™t mind sacrificing a week for. Hell, Iâ€™m well prepared to sacrifice my own life in order to stop the pain. Iâ€™ve been to a psych ward before, and itâ€™s kind of nice since itâ€™s a way to kind of die a temporary death and be away from everything else in my life. Itâ€™s not as good as death though, since Iâ€™ll still be fucked up in the head and as long as Iâ€™m fucked up Iâ€™ll suffer, but itâ€™s better than suffering and still having to do shit.

Anywho, if the psychiatry route doesnâ€™t work I can always kill myself, but it seems stupid not to take advantage of psychiatry to the fullest while I can, and that means telling my therapist enough where I could be hospitalized.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fd5wyz/am_i_the_only_one_who_doesnt_really_care_if_im/

Hello folks!!,"Hello people, I'm a 23 spanish male who has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety these last 7 years I don't know what action could lead to this but I don't really care about this.  


I've been struggling with suicide toughts these last years and I don't think I can't control it for so much time. I'm sad because there are people that worries about me, I will miss probably my cat and I know that my mother will be sad but sometimes I cannot hold this any longer. I cannot express how I feel with her because I don't wanna make her suffer. But I don't think I'm prepared to live in this world.

I'm trying to do my best, I'm trying to improve my mental health, I'm taking my medication but I don't think I will ever be really happy, I don't really think I could be usefull for this society. I've social problems, I cannot even go out of my home and I can't even get out of bed somedays. 

I'm really trying to be a happier version of myself but it's really hard.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fd1ex5/hello_folks/

My reasons you will probably laugh at if I told you. Would probably tell me this and that and other shit. Tell me to get the fuck over it but again, I'm at the point where I look at ways to kill myself knowing I CAN'T. Because I know I will fuck up other people.

I don't even want help anymore,"I'm fucking tired of people telling that everything will be fine and I feel like they're the ones that are ill for not seeing how fucked up the world is. Just look at this sub, every few minutes someone desperately looks for help and tells how miserable he or she is, sometimes without even being noticed. Now think of how many of all suffering people don't even seek for help because nobody gives a fuck, that's the human nature. It's just that it hurts. Even if someone ""wants to help you"" it's just because he or she will feel as a better person and then will leave you like a trash that you are so why even bother looking for help? Maybe depression is just a name created by people who are too scared of what reality is like. What if depression is perceiving the world as it is, while having good mental health means to disctract oneself from others pain?

What is wrong with my brain?,"So life is okay pretty good I guess wish we made more money but Iâ€™m happy. Or Iâ€™m not. Doesnâ€™t matter I still feel the very VERY strong need to kill myself and it lasts for a while like a week or for a short term like a few hours. Sometimes I feel like I have to slit my wrists in a tub or put that bullet in my brain or swerve into a truck but I know better. Itâ€™s something in my brain that is triggering this. I am a Christian a real one and I ask God at times to take this from me and it helps but itâ€™s like a voice a little guy on my shoulder waiting and watching and anything can trigger it. UHG! So frustrating. I think about how my dog, my husband, my brother sister and nieces and nephews need me but the voice doesnâ€™t care. I was just wondering if there is a part in the brain that does this? I have never done hard core drugs but my mother was high on speed when she was pregnant with me... and she has a dopamine issue because of all the drugs and falls into deep depressions or gets suicidal from it. Maybe itâ€™s hereditary or maybe because of the drugs she did when pregnant caused the issue with my brain?

I've been planning for years.,"Over the course of my life, I have attempted suicide four times. Each time, I was hospitalized, and each time I've tried again. The last times, it failed because someone found and stopped me. My ex boyfriend commit suicide last year. I have difficulty making plans due to a mild obsessive compulsive disorder, and just finding time. 
I have a heart condition that has been steadily worsening after a miscarriage, and due to it, I can't hold down a regular job and have since resorted to online work that pays like shit. I'm homeless. I have only two people in any sort of position to provide support, emotionally. And even though it's looking like the most difficult parts of life are ending and getting better for me, I don't honestly believe a life with all these new restrictions is worth it. 
My family is going on vacation soon. I wasn't invited. That week, I can complete the steps the way I planned, if I want to. Now the question is if I even have the physical strength for one last shot at it. 
Who knows? 
It might fail again. But I have no doubt I'll keep trying. It's the only thing I haven't given up on.
Meditation and such seems to point me in this direction. Tarot readings, horoscopes, all of it seems to be dropping hints that this is it. The main difference between all the times before, is that this time, I have nothing left to be afraid of.

Should I visit a psychiatrist?,"M/16, currently going through depression and can't talk to anyone. I've been visiting a psychotherapist for about 2 years and a psychiatrist for several weeks but just decided to stop going there like 6 months ago. I've been diagnosed with social anxiety and have depression but never actually talked about that with anyone, not even with my parents or the therapists. My everyday life goes like this: wake up, survive 7 hours at school, come home, play video games for rest of the day since I don't have anything better to do, cry into sleep, repeat. In school I barely speak to anyone even though I am going in the same class for over 5 years now. Only have 1-2 friends but they mostly only see me as the last choice everytime and only want to meet up when no one else has time. Recently we got someone new in the class and it seems like he had more social contact with the everyone else in the past 3 days than me in the last 5 years. Everyone think's i am introverted and it's kinda true, but only because I get rejected by everyone I even try to talk to and get excluded from everything. When people throw parties, I never get invited but people they barely talk to get invited. My grades are horrible and I am about to get off the school and don't even know what I want to become, since i just stopped caring after I noticed that everyone ignores me and no matter how hard I try to build up a new friendship / contact, I get rejected. I am the kind of person to look at my phone and than ask someone what time it is just so I have somewhat of a social interaction lmao. My parents only see my grades but don't care about my feelings. Because of this happening over many years (basically my whole life) I began to hide behind a emotionless mask. I am not able to express my feelings. nothing. The only thing i can do is laugh (because of something funny, not because i am actually happy) or hate on something. Even if anyone would make me happy, e.g. inviting me to a party, I couldn't show it and still act bored / emotionless because I am too afraid what people would think when I suddenly change and behave like everyone else. I also don't know anymore how to feel empathy. Like i would really like to and empathize with someone but no matter how hard I try it just doesn't work. When someone is sad I can say to myself ""this person is sad"" and feel bad about it, but I cannot comprehend it. I also feel absolutely worthless. For example I don't even say hi/goodbye to most people since i think i am not worth their time. When I meet someone from school outside accidentally, I walk pass them and they walk past me just because I don't want the other person to feel awkward. I know they don't like me and their day is probably ruined just by seeing me so i don't try to force the contact. At this point in my life i noticed that people are just assholes not caring about anyone. Everyone has their perfect life and ignores me so trying further wouldn't change anything. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. In the past i began to think more often about how it would be if just killed myself. I am not really thinking about doing it, but honestly I couldn't care less if I just got hit by a but. I feel like visiting the psychiatrist / therapist wouldn't change anything since I am not being honest to them anyways and don't know how I could be. Anyone good experiences with psychiatrist? Did it help in your case?

Life is unbearable. I'm losing my mind. I wish I had the courage to end this shit. Praying that someone out there reads this.,"I've been realizing some damn hard truths about myself. I've never been happy, ever since I was a little kid I felt like I was ""bad"". You know how children play ""house"" and it can be used in therapy to evaluate their outlook and issues? When I was a kid, I would play ""house"" with my fingers: there was the mom, dad, brother, and sister (me, the pinky finger). Each time, everyone would gang up on and beat up the sister. I just remembered that I used to ""play"" that game the other day - I don't think I have any real excuse for that, I was anxious as hell from a young age and irritable as fuck, but what kind of kid thinks of that shit? I was messed up back then.


I've talked to professionals. They seem to think that this is more than anxiety and depression. They say that I've faced a lot of trauma in my life. I suppose it makes sense. My parents were heavily abused during their childhoods, my mom even tried to kill herself as a young kid. My dad was an abusive alcoholic for most of my childhood. He and my mom would fight a lot - they would swear at each other, he would hit and throw things at her, she would scream at him and they would usually tell each other to go to Hell or drop dead. My dad was verbally abusive, and I remember he would hit my brother too. I presume he hit me, but I don't remember. All I remember is that when I was a teenager, he got so angry at me that he held me down on the couch. I was so detached, all I thought was how he was so angry he was about to drool on me, and how it was gross. I love my parents, despite their flaws. I just don't like them. We fight all the time. When I was younger, I remember that often when I got into a row with one parent, the other would get involved and then they would fight with each other. They would say horrible things like what I said above. They would say awful things to me too, like how once I was mad and my mom said I should look in the mirror to see how ugly I look. She would tell me to ""get out of her sight"" a lot. I get called a bitch at times. I'm told I treat them horrible, and I hate myself even more when they say that. Ugh. On the note of trauma, I realized earlier this year that I was repeatedly raped (oral, not vaginal) by my ex over the course of a year or so. That's also been tough to process.

It's fucked because I know my parents love me. They read to me as a child, they taught me to be independent. They just want me to be happy. But there's just always been something missing, I guess.

I realized that I may be in a chronic state of mild dissociation. I often feel detached from my body, my emotions, my environment, other people. I feel like I'm in a fog. My limbs aren't quite attached to my body, I feel floaty or dizzy. Weak and shaky. At times I dissociate harder, and I go totally numb. Can't move. Can't talk. Things look smaller, I float above or behind my body. My vision gets weird. It's scary yet comfortable because I'm aware that I'm further detached from myself and in a limbo for an hour. It fades and I get a headache, my body hurts, and I'm exhausted. Then it's back to reality, and I feel even more off for the rest of the day. I've noticed I also mildly dissociate when I try to sleep. My head is disconnected from my body, my limbs feel large or disconnect from my body. It's incredibly disturbing and I don't know why it happens. I never even realized I apparently dissociate until I started thinking about my childhood. Experienced some crazy depersonalization and derealization. When it happened, I realized that it was *very* familiar and I remembered doing it a lot as a kid. That realization fucked me up.


What really makes me feel crazy is the apparent somatic symptoms. I developed chronic visual snow and headaches as a teenager. I also started getting ocular migraines. Numerous tests and exams showed that all is well - it's just stress. My mouth has been hurting for the past year, as well. I even got an extra wisdom tooth removed, thinking that was the source of the pain. Nope. The pain persists, and is very noticeable when I'm stressed. Xrays and exams show that things are fine. I feel like a damn hypochondriac or like I'm malingering...but this is all very real to me.


I feel weak a lot. I am also dizzy, or like my brain is rotting, or stuffed with cotton/fog. My head is never ""clear"". I can't focus on much. Working is difficult. I can't truly interact with friends or family anymore. My weight has been all over. Due to horrible anxiety, I had lost a third of my body weight in 9 months. When I fell into this double depression, I lost 14 pounds in 2 weeks. Then someone I care about confronted me about the seriousness of it all. I tried to maintain my weight, and it worked for a month. Then I had a little breakdown and lost 7 pounds in 5 days. Started an antidepressant and became apathetic as hell - had an aborted suicide attempt and binge ate like crazy even though I wasn't hungry. I was like ""fuck it I deserve to gain weight and look disgusting"". I've gained 10 pounds in a week. I hate myself so much.


The more I realize, the more I hate myself. I've tried six or seven antidepressants, I've tried therapy a few times and am trying again. On another med right now. It all feels so damn hopeless. I've wanted to die since I was 13, and every day is just full of more pain and despair. 


People tell me not to give up on myself, but it gets more and more tempting as time goes on. Ever since I was 15, I always had a strong feeling I would die by suicide. I figured I wouldn't kill myself until I was 27 or 28, but things are becoming more disasterous. I just wish I had the courage to end this suffering soon. I feel like such a disgusting coward and a fraud. I'm ashamed to exist, to take up space in this world.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fcq1c9/life_is_unbearable_im_losing_my_mind_i_wish_i_had/
Going through a bad episode. Holding on by a thread. One little thing could push me over the edge.,"My bedroom and bathroom look like a hurricane struck them and I canâ€™t even eat normally, if at all. I can barely move. Thatâ€™s not an exaggeration, just doing simple tasks feels like agony. I havenâ€™t self-harmed in almost a year, yet I feel like relapsing. I just want to give myself alcohol poisoning or jump off of a bridge over an interstate. I feel like a burden on my fiancÃ©. I know he loves me and that heâ€™s concerned but he has his own problems and Iâ€™m only adding to his. I donâ€™t recognize myself anymore. I donâ€™t know who the fuck I am. I dread the future. Watching my boomer parents suffer from addiction, depression and loneliness and struggle to afford retirement doesnâ€™t give me high hopes. I despise the fucking world.

I'm invisible,"Granted I'm known by many acquaintances but have zero friends. I am often repeating myself because so called friends don't listen or dont hear me or frankly, don't give a shit. I've been suffering from bipolar disorder, manic depression, for upwards of 18 years. I told myseld if I could just make it past 27 yrs things would get better. I've been hospitalized, most recently in September 2019, the staff basically said they don't treat us but just monitor us until we are stable on meds and fit to leave. I have no family, raised in the foster care system and I'm completely alone. I don't see the point in living anymore if I'm constantly in mental agony or being ignored or used on every level. I've taken care of people I thought were friends because I have so much love to give but misguided as usual I end up used and thrown out like a tissue or ignored blatantly. I can't keep a job so my stability is often rocked by my own uncontrollable emotions and outbursts and I can't cope anymore. I'm losing hope and honestly just would like someone to acknowledge that I am alive and a sensitive but real person. Even then I don't know how to curb the feelings and thoughts of suicide. My closest friends growing up have all passed, either by suicide or excessive drug use I'm honestly debating the same path because without them I'm more alone than ever.

Coming to terms that maybe I just want to end it all and be done with it.,"Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts for a very long time. Iâ€™ve seen my GP, been put on meds, Iâ€™ve been to counselling you name it Iâ€™ve tried. But apart of me just feels like Iâ€™ve had enough and the only option is just to end my life. Sounds dramatic and selfish but if Iâ€™m honest I just feel like I have nobody there for me anymore and Iâ€™m just disappointing people around me like my parents for example, I know deep down that Iâ€™m just a failure in their eyes and all Iâ€™m doing is prolonging more upset for them as Iâ€™ve made there lives difficult in certain aspects with my depression and constantly making them worry. But I also feel as tho if I end it then there wouldnâ€™t be that worry Iâ€™d then be gone. if I speak to my friends about it theyâ€™ll just turn around and say man up or stop being soft. Which has now just caused me to believe that I donâ€™t have anyone there close to me to talk to, feel like Cant rely on anyone anymore and I just would be better off dead. Me and my ex split 6 months ago a short term relationship but that was one thing I felt really happy about and that ended because of how I am, just sad and perhaps not all there, or perhaps Iâ€™m just not capable in being in a relationship as thereâ€™s just clearly something wrong with me. I donâ€™t see myself moving on from her to another as it shattered me deeply and I just canâ€™t seem to want to get back out there, I just donâ€™t believe Iâ€™m that type of person for anyone like she was at the time. Many things I could add to the list like Iâ€™m mid 20s I only have a part time job and I donâ€™t feel motivated or want to look for a career because I just donâ€™t feel Iâ€™m good enough anymore. Feels as though Iâ€™m really done with life and that my times is up and I donâ€™t really know what to do anymore. Iâ€™m just sad and existing in a world that I donâ€™t want to be apart of anymore and Iâ€™m typing this really because I donâ€™t know who else to talk to about it anymore. I just want to crawl in a ball and cry every day and I wake up and go to sleep thinking I want to be dead.

A story to hopefully bring you back from the brink of suicide...,"Hi there, I donâ€™t know if this will help you at all, but if it helps even one person, thatâ€™s enough for me. A bit of back ground information, I am a 22 year old that has been suffering from severe depression for the past year, with suicidal thoughts everyday of every hour. I felt like I was already dead cause no one seemed to notice me and I was slowly wasting away from the inside out. I also began to hear voices that would constantly berate me and tell me to kill myself, and after this, I sought help from my GP and was put onto anti-depressants (Sertraline) which did absolutely nothing. They didnâ€™t make it worse, but they certainly didnâ€™t make it better.

I was then put onto another anti-depressant (Mirtazapine) which I started taking at the beginning of February 2020, which seemed to help. I had the energy to finally get out of bed, take a shower and leave the house. But a couple of weeks ago, I noticed that although I had the energy to get up and go about my daily life, I was still thinking about killing myself everyday, but this time it was different as I had the energy and motivation to actually come up with a detailed plan and go through with it; and this scared me so much as I have never felt an urge to kill myself as much as I have in the last couple of weeks. 

So yesterday, I had a lot to deal with. My partner has been very sick with an unknown illness for nearly a year, so his parents rushed him to hospital. I was an absolute mess as I have been really struggling to 
silence the suicidal thoughts, whilst also fulfilling my duty as a carer for my partner. I had a mental breakdown after they took him to the hospital as the voices wouldnâ€™t stop. I actually began shouting back at them, but after a few minutes sobbing on the bathroom floor, I became completely numb and decided to follow through with my plan. 

I grabbed my supplies, which involved a dog lead, but I had made sure to buy this one especially for this occasion as it perfectly fit around my neck and had a sturdy metal clip which I could attach to the banister which would hold my weight. I was ready to do it, I was ready to go, and I put the collar around my neck and began to push my neck down into the collar to cut off the blood supply to the main artery in my neck, I heard this would only take a minute or so to make me unconscious, and the whole time I was holding my dog close to my chest cause I was so scared, but I wanted to die so badly. As I could feel myself going, I stopped. And I donâ€™t know what stopped me, but part of me thought that it wasnâ€™t my time to go. So I ended up picking up the phone and calling someone, who managed to calm me down and helped me look at everything from a different perspective. 

I know a lot of people will say that itâ€™s selfish for feeling suicidal or committing suicide due to the hurt it would cause to family/friends etc but from what I felt yesterday, none of that mattered. I truly believed that I wanted to die, and if I hadnâ€™t have stopped myself when I had, I would probably be dead now. 

But this morning, my partner finally got an official diagnosis of what has been making him so ill. I am currently sat in the hospital waiting for him to come out of surgery, and I have been told by the doctors that he is going to live a very healthy, normal life after this operation. If I had have killed myself yesterday afternoon, I would never have gotten to find out that my partner was going to be okay. I would never get to marry him in April. I would never get to see him healthy and happy again. All of these things I would have never known if I was dead now. I can now look forward to being able to spend time with my partner who can now start to enjoy his life again, and I can try and enjoy mine as much as I can knowing that he will be around for a long time. 

What Iâ€™m trying to get at after my long ass story, is that if there is any sort of hope you can cling onto, whether thats a friend, a pet, something youâ€™ve got planned in the near future, or even just the feeling of the sun on your skin. Anything to get you through each day. You never have know when your life could take a turn for the best, or if something amazing will happen; and all of these things you will never get to experience if you end it all now. Iâ€™m not here to say that you shouldnâ€™t do it, because at the end of the day, Iâ€™m just some stranger on the internet that you donâ€™t know. But what I do know is that things can always get better. Always. But you never know when; and youâ€™ll never know if youâ€™re not here.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fcuzx0/a_story_to_hopefully_bring_you_back_from_the/

I dont want to die. I dont want to keep breathing.,"I use to drink often, I stopped. I'm very intoxicated so I might be all over. Shit happens right. 

I've been depressed for so fucking long it hurts to think about. At 13, 16, 19 everyone says it'll get better. I'm 23 and nothing's gotten any better.

I had a 3 year relationship and she threw me to the curb. I had a 2 year relationship following (after a break from  the 1st, we only dated a year but were close/fuck buddies for a year leading to it) and we broke up tonight, fun fact we still live together until july. My depression doesn't stem from relationships, there's a plethora of things contributing to it. I think I'm out of my depth on this one. We were fuck buddies because I didn't want another relationship. I didn't want to give someone a chance to hurt me again. 

She was moving for school and I couldn't bare the thought of losing her so I asked her to date and we planned and did move in together.
I've punched myself in the face because it's less damaging then cutting myself. I think at this point if I self harm it'll be the end. I promised myself that long ago though I didn't follow through the last time I started cutting myself. This time I think I would, one  pump of adrenaline is all it would take then I wouldn't be hurt anymore. 

I left all my friends for her, I moved an hour away for her. I dont see a point in living, I dont see a point in eating or sleeping. 

I dont know what I'm expecting fro. This honestly, I have noone but my sister and I hate being a burden on her (though tonight she may have kept me here). I know how I'd do it, it would be a 10 minute trip to get what I need. I dont want to but I have nothing and noone. No friends, out.of my family only my nana and sister talk to me. I've texted my dad yesterday and today about a car issue and that's the most we've talked in 2 days than I can remember. Usually it's around 1 a month, sometimes more sometimes less.

I'm a burden on everyone. I think the world would be a better place. All I can think about is putting a knife against my throat and givin' er. 

Relationships didn't cause this, certainly attributed. No friends, no family, noone to hurt if I die. I dont know what I was hoping to accomplish with this post but I think its pushed me farther towards doing it.

I hope you have a good day, thanks for taking a few minutes to read my messy/suicidal thoughts.

Maintaining Relationships with People,"Hello!

First of all, I really appreciate that you are taking the time to read my post and whether you were able to provide me with advice or not, thank you!

I feel like in order to give a better understanding of my situation, I need to talk about what I've gone through (I'm sorry that it end being a very long post)

When I was a kid, I was pretty much normal and had my group of friends but I used to be very shy and faced a lot of verbal abuse at that time but kept quite and thought it was a normal and ok thing, it didn't affect me though very much because of that. However in middle school, I've experienced trauma that changed me forever and left a very deep scar on me emotionally that took me years to overcome because no one tried to help, those who see me went through it and those who I spoke to about it didn't try to help. For years I had trust issues and was paranoid most of the time, it was my first experience of feeling alone and that no one understands me, and slowly I started to drift away and shut myself out, I just wanted to be alone and because of that I started to lose friends but I didn't care at that time, I thought I was doing the right thing by avoiding as much social interaction as possible. I guess in a way I was trying to protect myself.

The years after that, I've tried to regain my social life back and make friends again, I tried everything that I can from trying to act as a happy and funny person cause no one wants to see the real me, my depressing and sad self who wants to make friends with such a person? and when it actually works out, I thought I was doing the right thing but it ends up making me more depressed cause it takes me a lot of effort to be ""that person"" and I really didn't felt like I'm making any deep connection with anyone so I was like screw it, I'll just be myself by which I mean that I will not try anything to be forcefully liked by others and I thought since I'm into so many things, I will probably find someone who is into one of these things and be friends with but that didn't work out either. I kinda became that extra friend in a group that her existence or not didn't make any difference or that friend who you come to when your other friends are not around or that person you hang out not because you enjoy their company but you just don't want to be sitting alone. That messed me up in my senior year of high school, I felt like shit and I spent most of the time during the break in the toilet cause I rather that than feeling like shit when I am with others. And just to be clear, they are not awful people and they didn't say anything bad to me, it's just I've been friends with them for so long and whether at that time when I was trying to be the funny and happy person or myself, either way, I never felt I belong or that anyone cared, I felt I was just someone they knew and sure why not they can call a ""friend"".

In college though is where my struggle peaked, all those friendships that I made in high school are slowly disappearing everyone was moving on with their lives and I guess that means leaving unwanted relationships behind but regardless I did what I thought was right and did my part. I've reached out to them but it always ends up a one-sided relationship with everyone apparently and no one will reach out to me if I don't so I stopped. There was this one person I was close to during my school years and I tried to be the friend she can rely on in time of needs and depend on, I wanted to be always there for her but she never makes time for me but somehow she can with others so I tried to put ""our friendship"" to the test and just respond coldly to her messages just to see if she will ask what's wrong, I want her to notice that there was a problem and see if she gonna care about our friendship but she ends up unfollowing me in social media and blocked me out of her life that simply even though she perfectly knows me too well and knows that this is not my kind of behavior.

I had no problem talking with strangers, I can open a conversation and interact with anyone easily so trying to get to know people in college was not difficult except I don't think anyone wanted to be my friend, I just remain their classmate. I end up making just one friend in college, we had a lot in common and I really believed it could work out but it took a lot of ignoring of her frustrating attitude which sometimes makes me wonder if she will bother to hold on to me if I ever show my frustration. At some point, I've gone through a deep depression that made me very suicidal and thought there was no future for me but I was trying to hold on to hope and as much I want to act tough and act like I can handle this I couldn't, I really just need someone to talk to and so far as you can see I had no one except this college friend and I didn't know how it will go but thought let's give it a try so I opened up to her and after when I was done, the conversation didn't last for 2 minutes and I was so crushed because sure maybe she was not the perfect person to open up to but at that time I didn't have any option and I just really needed someone in my life to talk to. I really thought I'm gonna do it on that day cause I really lost hope.

As of now, it feels like I'm back at the starting point. I probably sound very awfully pathetic person or stupid to you. Every time when I'm not able to maintain any relationship in my life, I asked myself what's wrong with me? what have I done wrong in my life? I realized after a while that I try to fix things so hard in my life that I end up breaking it or damaging it but I always thought I was doing the right thing and doing my part by reaching out or helping out but somehow it doesn't make things better. It always seems that I'm the one making the effort and if you didn't notice, throughout those stages of my life that I mentioned no one tried to be my friend or wanted to but I've always seemed to be the one who wants to be someone's friend. Right now, I'm very much confused about what exactly I'm supposed to do. I just don't understand why I'm struggling so much to find somewhere I belong, I feel very much rejected no matter what I do. If I make an effort or not I end up alone either way. Everyone in my life seems to give up on me and no one bothers to hold on to me. I just don't know if I'm supposed to give up and just accept the fact that maybe this is how things supposed to be in my life.

I tried not to bore you guys with the details and complicate stuff, I hope my situation was made clear and it wasn't confusing. I just really need some advice cause I don't think I'm going to find a good one from my mind. One again, thank you for taking the time to read my post!",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fd3wz8/maintaining_relationships_with_people/
Is suicide worth it?,"Hi, I'm 15 years old. Currently been pulled out of school,due to many reasons, which is why I'm here so that I can clear my mind of any other thoughts that may lead me to things that I might regret later on. I'd like to share first my story so that no one would come at me.(ex. You're just 15, its just a phase. Pls stop doing this to get attention.etc) when I was very young I didn't really paid any attention whenever my father and mother would fought or when my sister( the 2nd oldest) would always ignore or would get pissed at me, because I thought that it was the norm. But things got worse when the whole family fought because of the sh*tty things my father had done and it all started because of me drinking a godd*mn cola, it went like this: ""who drank the cola?"" My father asked I was very scared so I didn't replied he asked that again and again until my mother told my father off, until they just started to shout at each other which forced my eldest sister to butt in, and the whole thing went to what my father did, such as adultery and abuse. So it lead to my father pushing my mother, which pushed my sisters to fight my father, physically. I couldn't do anything but it really shocked me, and blamed myself for it. After the whole ordeal, it took 5 months to mend back the family. I thought finally, but I still had other problemsto face. I know that its stereotypical of me to say this but my asian parents(filipino) would always forced me to study when I never wanted any of this, I just wanted to play with other kids with no care in the world but I couldn't. My mothers way of teaching really left a toll on me cuz she would just hit me whenever I get the wrong answer or if I couldn't reply with the correct answer. I've always been the 2nd honor roll, but when she said this to me on the way back home ""pls don't drop your grades it would be really embarassing to my friends if you did"" that was jusy painful for me. others may think that I'm overreacting it was still really painful, tho I still couldn't speak my mind, I continued still, I was getting bullied as well for no reason. Years went by I was already in my first year of highschool in a prestige academy. I made friends, been respected, and I had little bumps in my grades but I still felt really great. Then one day one of my friends who is a guy told me to hang out with him, I couldn't tell that he had malicious intents. I was just really stupid. He cornered me ""can i touch your boobs?"" He said, I was shocked and refused but he was really strong and managed to touched me and resorted to attempted rape, afte I broke free, crying and running in the same day. I couldn't tell anyone nor my parent. So I just cried the whole night and proceeded to go to school and bearing to be with him in the same class. I had finally mustered up the courage to tell the guidance councelor, and due to that he got expelled and words got out because of the things he did and so I got harassed even more with the guys but I couldn't do anything and told myself to bear with it. I now entered my 2nd year of highschool which started the changes with me I became more irritated, a hot mess. I've been disrespectful to my mom, the reason we fight every morning. And another problem rosed up. A mistress of my father contacted me, I knew that she was just messing with me but I felt so angry. So I told my guidance counselor because I didn't know what to do anymore, so she told my mom and filed a case to my dads mistress, but the case got dropped because they said the account iwas fake when clearly it wasn't, I know I'm no professional but it was pretty obvious that it wasn't fake. I got even more mad because my mom didn't mind and told me it must be  Gods plan (I'm christian but I'm not really on how my mother believes)now things really went downhill for me.I couldn't eat, I couldn't think of happy thoughts, I  would just think of nothing, or everything is just useless even humanity, and that I wished I could just sleep and die from it. Things got even worse because my sister(the 2nd eldest), whenever I tell her shes wrong she would get mad at me,whenever I got mad at her she would get made at me, even tho she was in the wrong, but she was too prideful and wouldn't say sorry but I still did anyway. When things got even more hectic I started to hurt myself, my mom knew and told me angrily that I did it because of the internet. I couldn't take it anymore everything that I do is wrong,  its like I'm the misfortune. I wanted to kill myself, which is why I went to the guidance counselor, and told my mom everything, so she pulled me out of school, and appointed me to a psychiatrist but the medicines was too much for me, in short it was painful, and it makes me go insane for some reason, and even messed with my diet(made me eat more). So my mom stopped me from drinking the pills, but the withdrawal was sh*tty too. I still get mad at everything and I really want to kill myself. I mean I don't know I'm still thinking of the pros and cons of me killing myself. Its just that I wish in my sleep someone would kill me. But I really wanna know if suicide is worth a shot, because I regret everything and I'm desperate( this isn't the whole thing sthst happened but its getting long that it)",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fcxkhb/is_suicide_worth_it/

i dont even know what to title this,"i think i saw myself in the tub five times this whole day so far and its only 4pm. i care for the people around me very deeply and just the thought of them being devastated when i leave makes me even more depressed. i deal with all of this all by myself as everybody does. i feel bad because everyone eventually leaves me after realizing how difficult my situation is and how draining it can be to deal with it. i guess you can say iâ€™m a big ass burden.

iâ€™m not the best worker. iâ€™m incredibly lazy. not because i choose to have fun, but because i donâ€™t feel good enough. my motivation to do anything is at a 0. another factor of why is i never know what i want to do. my upbringing wasnâ€™t great and i was always constantly thrown off course from the things i really wanted to do to cater to people who didnâ€™t care to see me happy. now iâ€™m kinda doing my own shit without being asked, but it took me almost a year to learn how to think for myself. all thanks to my current partner though.

iâ€™m starting to lose hope though. although i do have people i care for, iâ€™m afraid of telling them how i feel beyond just â€œiâ€™m depressed.â€",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fd1fa1/i_dont_even_know_what_to_title_this/

I'm been drinking.,I been thinking about religion. Like if you believe their is a God. Well he or she since God created man and women. Well God is the only super hero. I started to believe in a God since DINOSAURS. Even I try to pray to a God to take me back to 1994. Even my life is going no where. I have a mental illness called schizophrenia where the brain cognitive is dysfunctional. Hallucinations and hearing voices that arent their. Which makes me think solipsism. But hell im no God when I believe a God. Since I didnt create clouds trees or even DINOSAURS. I admit mental illness has no path of success. Even I want to give up to pray for a new one cause im getting old. If I could live forever I would cause dying isnt going to get better. It only gets better to a human that isnt God.

The person who only has depression and not a literal learning disability that impacts how you interact with others, and they treat you horribly because of it.

am I suicidal?,"hi. I'm not sure if this is one of those things where if you have to ask it then there is a definite answer, but I'm not sure if what I experience is truly suicidal thoughts.

when I don't feel sad I become very thankful and when I try to express to God thanks for what he has given me, I feel guilty for spending my time self harming or being self destructive. I feel I'll never be able to truly convey how thankful I am for what he's given me and I'm back to square one, just wishing I was never born so I wouldn't have these thoughts and emotions.

I don't really care about anything and many of my thoughts are just wishing I could disappear or wishing I was ""less"" in every possible way. I want to not be alive so I don't feel the emotions I feel. I do not often contemplate different ways to kill myself, it is moreso just wishing I wasn't born in the first place or hoping someday something else will happen to me that makes this decision for me.

the majority of my thoughts are wishing I was dead or never born, and even when I'm happy I just wish I could stop feeling and the answer to that to me is death. is the way I'm feeling considered suicidal?

i`ll be sad to see it all gone, and i wish i had the strength to stay, but i no longer do, thats the complete truth

I have a fear of commitment, and committing to that decision is something I just canâ€™t do. Several times everyday, I daydream about someone walking up to me and killing me. If someone else did it for me, it would make things so much better.

Tonight is the night and I hate myself for it,"I am in the worst situation I have ever been in as I am about to become homeless. I returned to the UK after living abroad 5 months ago and things seemed promising at first however things went downhill pretty quickly. Finding a job has been a nightmare - i have decent experience and have had a lot of interviews but everywhere either ghosts me or rejects me. I get rejected a lot because I ""dont show I want the job enough"" but years of BPD and depression mean I find it incredibly hard to show my emotions. One company rejected me for this reason after 4 rounds of interviews!

On top of that, I was with a gambling addict a few years ago who made my life hell and created all kinds of debt for me (signing up to websites with my details, getting loans out in my name). Completely my fault for sticking with him so long but he has left me with Â£12,000 approx worth of debt so of course I am being chased on those debts too. I am also not entitled to any benefits. 

So finally I have ran out of money and am 2 months behind on rent, I let my rental company know today and was pretty honest about my circumstances (I said it was because of redundancy as it's less embarrassing). We agreed I will move out this week, not that I was expecting any sympathy but the lady at the rental company was a dick. So now I am homeless - I am not pregnant or super young or super old or anything like that so the chances of me getting any help are pretty much zilch. 

I am leaving behind the most amazing boyfriend that I never thought I would find and that's why there is so much guilt. I think deep down I am leaving this message in the hope one day he sees it and knows there is nothing he could have done. I have tried talking to him about this but he thinks I am just having a BPD episode and am exaggerating. There is no way he can help anyway he certainly couldn't help me financially (nor would I expect him to!) and he lives in the same house so staying with him isn't an option. 

My main wish is that him and my friends will be OK eventually and will understand that I am in a much better place!",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fcxxst/tonight_is_the_night_and_i_hate_myself_for_it/

you mean more than you know,"ive been clean from heroine for 2 weeks, and even since the unbearable pain of withdrawals have passed, the mental emptiness has not, and might not for a very long time. like many of you, i still think about ending my life every day. 

2 days ago, i was out on my porch, writing a suicide note. seemingly, getting the last rays of sunshine i would ever feel. I was content with that. Then, I heard my phone ringing. Who the hell is calling me on my last day here. 

My best friends twin sister had been diagnosed with Leukemia. Think about your BEST friend, and how their pain, is often yours, as well. I mean, why wasn't I already on my way to grab my car keys and see him and his family? 

After a few grief-stricken hours spent with them, I headed back home. Then, I realized; for a whole two hours, did I really just forget about fucking killing myself?

The one thing that took me out of my thoughts of death were simply thoughts about someone else. And it helped me realize why I ended things with heroine, and not with my life. 

I'm not one to know whether it is healthy or not to love someone more than you love yourself. All I know, is that a phone call from my best friend stopped me from killing myself. The circumstances of why he called me reminded me of the importance of me still being alive. Anyone who has experienced something like this, I encourage you to not see these instances as coincidences, but as testaments to the fact that you are meant to still be alive.

I don't really know how to wrap this up. I just hope you all know how much you really matter. Because now, I remember how much I matter. I know this won't help everybody, but I hope it will help somebody.

The only person who can make me better is myself and I canâ€™t do that,"TLDR: only I can make myself happy again and I know for a fact Iâ€™ll never do that, Iâ€™m hopeless

â€”â€”â€”

Iâ€™m only making myself feel worse because I have so many things to do and Iâ€™m not doing any of them because Iâ€™m lazy and want to lie in bed all day. Then the stress of it all just builds up and the stress paralyzes me into inaction even more and then more stress piles up and so on

Iâ€™m digging myself a hole, Iâ€™m making myself worse off and ruining my own life

And at the end of the day itâ€™s up to me to fix myself. Itâ€™s up to me to get things done and to get my life in order, to make myself happy again

But I know for a fact I canâ€™t do that. Iâ€™m too lazy, too tired, canâ€™t focus on anything or anyone other than myself. Iâ€™m pathetic 

Iâ€™ll never be able to find the will to fix myself so why am I even still here? Just to stay miserable until I inevitably kill myself down the road because Iâ€™m incapable of helping myself

Nothing will ever be able to fix me. Itâ€™s all up to me. Itâ€™s up to me and thatâ€™s scary because Iâ€™ll never be able to help myself. I canâ€™t, I know for a fact I canâ€™t and I wonâ€™t

Not because I'm alone( in an amazing relationship for over two years) not because I'm unemployed or broke( working at an amazing position as an HR vice president) not because I have abusive family( they're extremely supportive and I'd give my life for them), even if you have all of those you can still be miserable and not feel happy.

"I feel so lost and tired, so I'm writing it all out to make myself feel better a bit.","These days I just feel like running around in circles. I keep making the wrong decisions, all of which coming from my inability to control my emotions. I am currently facing the consequences of my decisions and of course, am very tired as I could not see any way for me to feel accomplished. Additionally, I have imposed problems upon others, including my loved ones. It all began so well. I was in this perfect mint condition of being an average student from a prestigious high school in my country. The school's full of brilliant kids I can't seem to catch up with, and once I feel exhausted to keep on competing with them academically for scholarships, I stopped trying. My mom was having a perfectly stable job, earning an equivalent of 500 USD each month. Yet, the toxic environmental conditions of the city we lived in back then made me feel really oppressed, not to mention I was absurdly overwhelmed by the isolated feeling the school gave me. 

That was when I decided to stupidly leave my country for another place that seemed more ideal - a country in Europe, with inarguably better climate (because I love cold weather), better food quality, generally peaceful urban life in contrast to the busy city ruled by crazy drivers. It felt great for the first few days of arrival and my head was temporarily free from all the pressure, but all magic comes with a price. 

Basic things in life such as water are ridiculously expensive here - it's stressful to think about it in the shower. Additionally, I've moved to a new school. What made me so reluctant about it was the fact that it's an international school: small but sweet community, but with tuition fees that have considerably stressed my mom out. The prices are equivalent of what my mother made in her old job in 2 years. Life was good until Coronavirus struck. Apparently, healthcare in Europe is downright FRUSTRATING. (sorry European friends) Few countries took the quarantine procedure seriously, and the country I'm living in now isn't one of them. I want to go back...

Days went by and I discovered that lots of kids in my old school are currently achieving something. Something that I once considered to be my dream, but had given up on it just because.....emotions. 

Ughh I don't know anymore... I'm so stressed atm I don't even know what I'm saying anymore.

I have cut a few slashes to my arm once, though not noticeable, and very much want to do the same again. I have so much to think about. I feel guilty for putting someone like my mom to go through things so I could get what I wanted.

I can't do it anymore.,"Hi.  I'd rather not say my name, but I'm 15 and I've been like this since I was 11.  I don't want to do anything anymore.  Everything just seems... boring.  I'm quite sick of everyday repetition.  Wake up, eat, go to school, come home, eat again, then sleep.  I've lost interest in all the games I thought were interesting before.  Now it's just as dull as a pencil that hasn't been sharpened in a couple years.  I don't want to do it anymore.  My grades are dropping like the downwards part of a roller coaster.  I hate everyone and everything.  I hate them because they are disgusting.  I hate them because they are annoying.  I hate them because they do nothing to help.  Everyone doesn't like me.  They only tolerate me.  They like to pick on me since I'm like this.  They think it's funny if someone is a failure.  Failures like me are disgraceful to everyone.  I can't do anything right.  I get yelled at by my mother for the smallest of things.  I have religious propaganda pushed on to me everyday and it doesn't stop.  I just need space.  I want to feel the same spark of interest I felt when I was a little kid.  Everyone thinks that I'm doing okay when they can clearly see that I'm internally suffering.  I don't want to live anymore.  Life was okay.  Life was great.  Hell, I'd even say that life was the best thing that happened to me.  But life just started going downhill and it's still going lower and lower than it was before.  If I killed myself all of my problems would go away.  Everyone couldn't bother me anymore.  Everything would be peaceful.  I'd all be okay.  I can't do it anymore.  Everything is too stressful to deal with.  I don't want to put up with this life anymore.  It already sucks enough as it is.  So why not just end it.

Am I being a burden on my family?,"I'm 16 F diagnosed with depression. I'm thinking of killing myself tonight. Tried yesterday, failed. One of reason behind this is that I'm being burden on my family. I don't have mental capacity to think clearly. So I'm asking you. 

Dropped this year boards because I wasn't able to study at all. Its near beginning to next session, and I haven't recovered a bit. Because my parents this is happening because of some sort of supernatural evil thing. After diagnosis they didn't took me to therapy ever again. Rather they took me to get rid of that evil thing. I'm not gonna be able to to study and waste all their money again. They also have to give dowry for my marriage and pay for my education. And waste my life, and their money. We have financial problems too.

I think it's justified to commit suicide.

But what if ruin their mental health.

My mom had BPD, and schizophrenia. My sister is 10. I think this will ruin their life. But we aren't close emotionally. They might also be better without me.

My reality is mess, I think I can never recover, and waste my life, and live like this for 60 years, which is so scary. My mom doesn't go to a doctor because she thinks this is because of that evil thing. I'm scared for her. She doesn't eat because she thinks her enemy is gonna kill her if she does so. No matter how much we insist to take her to a doctor, she refused.

I'm stuck.

I'm scared of all the suffering there are in the world. I've seen street dogs die because of road accident, and there's no one to even take care of the dead body. His hide was there at the road. 

Please don't say not to commit suicide, just because of your moral obligation. Please answer if my family would be better without me.

I deserve to die,"I'm 22 years old. And unlike most of the people here, I truly deserve to kill myself.

I've been verbally and physically abusive to everyone around me since I could talk. 

So far as humans go. I bullied kids when I was a kid. Lots of kids. I was never nice to anyone. I was mean to my parents. I hit. I beat up one of my friends. As an adult, I've been physically and verbally abusive to my mom. I've left her with black eyes. And my stepdad. I've told them both to kill themselves a million times. I've said some truly awful things. Not just to them. I lost a friend after I verbally abused her, too. And I've treated my best friend horribly.

Worse than that, the animals. Both of the first cats I ever had ran away, so I must have done something to them. The third, I chased her around and sprayed her with water and hit her. For years. She was traumatized. She hated me. She'd always scratch me up and I deserved it. The fifth cat ran away, I don't know what I did. The sixth cat I don't remember if I was mean or nice but I gave her to some old ladies because we had to move. I hope they loved her. My seventh cat is my current cat. I got her right before I turned twelve. I used to put a laundry basket over her and shake it while she screamed. She was just a little kitten. I stopped doing that at some point because my mom talked to me. But I hit her. Sometimes multiple times. This cat isn't traumatized mostly. She cuddles me every fucking night that I let her. But...

Then there's my dogs. I beat the shit out of my older dog, multiple times when I was an older teen. I beat him with shoes because he chewed them. He was just sad I had to go to school and I beat him. My younger dog I beat the shit out of once (maybe, technically, twice? same day in a short time period), ever. 1,264 days ago. I was so gutted about how badly I hurt him-- he was bruised under his fur and upset for days-- I swore never to beat any animal ever again, and I haven't. But I still hit them. I'm ""extremely abusive"". That's how my grandma describes me. My fucking grandma. (The dogs aren't traumatized at all anymore, but...)

I also ripped off a lizard's tail...and killed a lizard...but those were accidents. 

On top of all that, it's quite possible I'm a pedophile. When I was 14, I chased an 11 year old girl around trying to kiss her. (I succeeded. This happened 2x.) And when I was 19, I read 2 fanfiction about a sexual relationship between a 16 year old and a 12 year old. And I had dreams for years about rape? Of children? I mean, I also have OCD and it could just be that. But one day I abruptly decided that That Wasn't Going To Happen Anymore, and now it happens much less. It's unpleasant. 

I don't want to be like this. I don't want to be abusive to anyone. I was never abused. I recently started therapy (again). I'm on medication (Paxil). I think about the abuse all the time. It's probably 80% of my thoughts. I am trying to not do these things. To never be verbally or physically abusive again. I love my family and my pets and they have never deserved this. But I will never be able to undo the things that I have done. Even if I try to make amends. Even if I'm forgiven, which I am. I am a bad person, and thanks to what I've done, I will always be.

I deserve every ounce of guilt I've felt these past 1,264 days that I've known I've abusive. These past years where I didn't try to change until now. I deserve to feel this way every miserable day for the rest of my life. I deserve to kill myself.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fcvam7/i_deserve_to_die/

Everything in my life has gone to shit but the only reasons I'm still here is my cats,"I'm 22. I grew up in an emotionally, verbally, and occasionally physically abusive home. My dad became an alcoholic as a result of the abuse from my mom. I became the unwilling referee and parental therapist as a preteen and eventual side punching bag as a teen. My mom has tried to kill me a few times now - some before I was 18, some after, and also kidnapped me as a child after she and my dad had a fight. I spent all of my adolescence waiting for a chance to get out. CPS came twice but nothing ever helped. I got into a dream school and everything as a senior, but that got ripped away too. Mom refused to sign off on loans - which I could not get without a co-signer. There went my escape. 

They divorced. I became the physical punching bag for my mom. I cut my hair off to prevent her from grabbing it. My dad got worse. I tried to kill myself a few times, all of which failed for some reason or another. Got 51/50'd. My mom proceeded to use that as a threat from then on of where she could send me if I didn't behave. I stayed with my dad after that, and cut her off. Still was depressed as fuck though. Only person I could talk to about any of it was my grandma. One night talked to her and my aunt (who's racist and hates me) happened to also be there. She took the phone and screamed at me. Told me never to call my grandma again, told me to stop making up shit about my family and stop talking suicide to an elder. My grandma could handle it, she used to feel that way too - it's why I could talk to her about it. 

Fast forward a little bit and my dad (just after we finally patched our relationship and things looked better) suddenly died from his drinking problem. I had to go back to my mom because no other relative was an option. My mom immediately took it out on me, and I became terrified to even wake up. She tried to smother me to death, tried to choke me out with an aux cord, tried to shove me down the stairs, tried to push me out of a moving vehicle, etc. Yet every time blamed me. It was the worst year of my life, or so I thought. At least I had my grandma. She was depressed too, over losing her son, and because she was being abused by her daughter (the racist aunt). I was trying to help but it always got covered up somehow. Then exactly one year later, my grandma suddenly died. But she left me half her estate to protect myself, because she wanted me to move out and live near her. She was the only person left that wanted to help me. 

But then my aunt (the one from before) got hissy about the fact that her mom and I were closer than they ever were, and she lawyered up. She refused to give me a key, refused to give me the items my grandma specifically wanted me to have (because no proof), and informed me of the sale well after it happened while I was out of state. She also kept going through my mom, which was idiotic - as my parents divorced and I was an adult. I asked her about it, she dodged, so I wrote a letter. She never contacted me again for months, so I had to get an attorney (that I can't afford tbh) and we've been back and forth on that since. Now she's threatening to file the taxes under my name without my permission without my SSN so the IRS comes after me. All this over fucking recipe cards and a desk!  

I always think about wanting to end it, end the pain, end the inevitable suffering that always comes, but I can't. I can't leave my cats. I refuse to rehome, the word itself hurts me to even type or see. How could I do such a thing to my family? The only ones there for me? Anytime I cry they sit on me and purr or lick my face and one of them legit meows at me until i talk to her and she keeps meowing till i'm done and then snuggles. They are literally the closest to me and the only ones that keep me going. I just wish I could do something for them too (like find a new place to live, but I can't). My mom recently made credit cards under my name and maxed them out. Told me this just so ""I'd understand the position I'm in."" If anyone asks her she says it's just to help me build my credit. To which I'm sure is somewhat true, because she intends to sign my name off as a cosigner to a property she wants to buy. 

To her I've only ever been a means to an end. I just want out, I don't want to die. I want a place on my own with my cats, safe and sound. But I feel like I'll never get out. And I'm afraid to wish too because everytime I do I get something worse.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fcy97r/everything_in_my_life_has_gone_to_shit_but_the/
I donâ€™t care if it wins anymore,"People keep telling me that if I kill myself, then the depression will win the fight. Hereâ€™s the catch, they think I fucking care if it wins.

I'm pretty sure I'm just overreacting,"Hi everyone. I'm really not even in the mood to do this, but I don't want to be alone now. I'm having a breakdown and considering suicide. I think I'm overreacting to something, but I don't want to be judged right now. Can I ask that there be little to no judgement towards me please? I'm not in the right here, but I just want peace.

So today, my boss of a year told me she's relocating me. She said it's because of my body odor. She talked to me in January about it and I told her I'm doing my best. She told me today I was doing better but today it's been ""the worse it's been since then.""

I'm absolutely devastated. I have depression and schizophrenia, but I still brush my hair, brush my teeth, use deodorant, and body spray. I don't shower often because I have bad memories of when I was younger, I had severe eczema, and my skin would burn and peel when water touched it. I'm terrified of showers now. 

I know I have a responsibility to take care of myself, but it's so hard when I'm TRYING but no one seems to care that I'm trying. I also know my boss has been stressed lately, but I feel like she forgot what I told her in January and is snapping at me.

She also just sent me an email.

"" In January we had conversation about hygiene one that I had been reluctant to have. Â From that conversation I believed that you would rectify the situation. Over the the past few weeks hygiene has become an issue again.

I am not sure if I am able to assist you in figuring out how to go about resolving the problem. What I am sure of is that you are a great member of the team and I want you to continue to work in the office.""

I'm not even sure I want to be here anymore. I was feeling really good about myself today. I changed clothes, used deodorant and body spray, and brushed my hair for the first time in days. I'm also getting my first car tomorrow. I thought that I could have a week where I actually felt hopeful.

I know I'm overreacting, but I just feel horrible about myself. I called my dad crying and he told me it was my fault and that he isn't trying to ""hurt me"". I told him ""I shouldn't have even called anyone."" and hung up. 

I'm just really tired and considering overdosing when I clock out of work today. I have plenty of Zoloft, plenty of BuSpar, and one dose of hydrocodone. I just regret being here because I have my dog here with me on campus. I asked my dad to come and pick me up and he acted like I was asking him to move a mountain for me. Even though I pay for gas and food and bills. So I told him to wait until tomorrow, I just wouldn't go to work tomorrow.

I just really want to die because I feel so awful about myself. I feel like I'm not worthy of love. I feel like I'm not worthy of respect. I'm exhausted. I feel that it would be better if I was dead, so my boss wouldn't have to deal with me.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fd1mrm/im_pretty_sure_im_just_overreacting/

I always feel like killing myself on my birthday.,"Turning 31 on Friday. Every year since I was maybe 12 or 13 I have felt this way. Once in awhile I want to see friends, party, indulge. But that lasts for mere minutes. Then the doom and gloom sets in and all I think about is really sticking it to everyone and offing myself on my birthday. I feel like I only stay alive so no one's ""feelings get hurt"" 

I'm at a point now not only am I just drowning in self loathing...I literally live to pay bills and make sure everyone is happy. 

I can no longer financially, mentally or physically afford to stay alive.  If I do it. I want to write a really really mean note to make sure everyone just stays mad and is glad I'm dead. I want to spill everyone's secrets and turn everyone against one another. They wont miss me. They'll be too wrapped up embarrassed by their own actions that I'll unveil.

I always was the top grades on my class till i entered college and everything just fall .
Cant focus or study till i failed for first time in my life
And thats where i became depressed.
I was always that strange kid who dont think like a kid or play like them
I was just a smart kid who cant find a meaning for anything.
I wasnt sad but not that happy too .
Even when my dad died i felt nothing even so he tried to kill me twice but still did many good things to me .
I remember i only cried a little when i saw my sis crying really hard for him.
And then i became a depressed person after first year in college .
Going to uni was a hell for me
I just wanted to be alone and sleep forever.
Till recently i found the courage inside me to change my life 
I started nofap and started praying everyday and dieting .. deleted all video games and books or films i had.
Just to change my whole life and felt really good even so i had many faild attembs but tried to improve .
Now i got my grades and failed again..
I dont want to die now .. i finally found something i rly want to do. And want to improve my life
But unfortunally thats it for me
I know my mother gonna have like a heart attack if she saw my grades.. and me myself cant just live anymore.
I had enough of these empty feelings.
Its the 27th of this month
My last day.
Till then i will continue doing my ""life changing"" daily habbits and studying more than ever for last time to prove to myself i can do it like others before suiciding.

Parents donâ€™t get it,Iâ€™m 16 Iâ€™ve been severely suicidal since I was 10. When I was around 11 I slit my wrists and my parents walked in when I was bleeding out. They said they were â€˜busyâ€™ working and gave me antiseptic cream and bandaids instead of taking me to the hospital my dad walked in later that night and cried over me and basically called me selfish. No one ever talked about it again and I never received help. Iâ€™m now in 11th grade and school has never been worse Iâ€™ve already had 2 pretty serious breakdowns and Iâ€™m  only 6 weeks in. Through extensive online research I found some â€˜painlessâ€™ suicide methods and purchased the drugs and blades necessary to pull it off. I almost did it the other night but I want to finalise some things first.

school makes me feel suicidal. does anyone have the same experiences,"hi, id like some advice if thatâ€™s possible. i suffer from extreme anxiety due to environmental and emotional stressors. this makes it extremely difficult to physically sit down and complete schoolwork before the deadline. i also miss a lot of classes because i am scared of confrontation.

just yesterday i submitted a late essay assigned a few weeks back that was half assed and didnâ€™t even meet the page number requirements. this just perpetuates the existing anxiety because now i have to face the teacher tomorrow morning and possibly be questioned about my quality of work. i have a 504 plan but the thought of asking for extensions or additional help makes me feel pathetic.

anxiety + depression + an untreated eating disorder has caused my grades to falter ever since the start of last year . i am a senior in high school and am deathly afraid of being deferred from the colleges that i have been accepted to. the fact that i canâ€™t keep up with high school work suggests that ill fail at college too

iâ€™ve started becoming suicidal due to this. body dysmorphia makes it difficult just to step outside of my house. i have no friends, i am lonely and comfort myself with food, which i usually throw up after. the only people willing to listen to me are adults who are paid to do so

i fear that other people view me as undisciplined and lazy, or just plain stupid. there is no evidence against these perspectives as i keep all of my mental struggles hidden. in reality i am investing all of my energy just to haul my ass out of bed in the morning and get through the day. my mom works long shifts to sustain me but i as her child have nothing to offer in return- no friends or partners to introduce her to, no academic success or improvement, etc. on top of that she has to schedule all of my psych and therapy appointments which is difficult for her as a parent. sheâ€™d be better off if i werenâ€™t here to burden her. 

i have a bunch of upcoming psych appointments and have my fingers crossed to be prescribed medicine. maybe iâ€™d sulk less on some zoloft? but i know this isnâ€™t a way out at least not a permanent one. 

i am tired and want it all to end. i know better than to end my life over a situation iâ€™ll be out of in a few months but i canâ€™t stand the thought of dealing with this any longer.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fcwtp7/school_makes_me_feel_suicidal_does_anyone_have/

I can't take myself anymore,"I don't really know what im expecting of righting this but at this point i'm willing to do anything to stop this unbearable pain of existing.

I'm gonna give you a brief overview over my entire life and what exactly it is right now that lead me to the decision that my life is not worth living anymore.

Elementary School was hell. Had a teacher that sat me behind a bookshelf from which i wasnt even able to see the blackboard or participate in class because i was ""distracing"" the other children. The teacher videotaped me ""misbehaving"" in class to ridicule my parents and parentsmeetings. I was a smart kid. I was able to write and do basic math before i went to school. I was bored. When i was finished with my stuff I walked through the room and helped the children that were struggling. I dont see any misbehaving in that but maybe im wrong. Final report card was straight A's. Teacher still recommended that i go to a school for idiots. In my country this recommendation is on the report card. When i applied at ""normal"" schools not a single one wanted to teach me because of that recommendation which was just straigh up bullshit. In the end i found a school that saw my potential and didnt care about the recommendation. So i was able to get a decent education.

While all of that was happening home was hell. My dad was violent and abusive and my mother never intervened when he punched me in the face etc. i dont know if she did not care or if she was afraid. it doesnt matter to me. I felt and still feel abandoned. 

From age 9-12 my older brother was raping me over and over. Not like once a  month or something. EVERY SINGLE DAY. sometimes even multiple times. But who should i have asked for help? my father that is violent me? my mother that doesnt do shit? He even invited his friends to watch and spit on me.

With 14 i had the realization that i wasnt normal anymore. I wasnt talking alot. I stopped enjoying literally anything. Thats also when i started to cut myself.

Fast forward to me being 19. I finished school. Got my highschool diploma eventhough i was suffering from severe depression as i found out later. I also had 1 friend. Lets call her L. I got a job over 100 miles away from my parents. I moved out. Lived there in terrible conditions since i made almost no money. But i think i felt better. Im not sure since i was stoned most of the time. After 3 years living away from my parents L tried to commit suicide. I blame myself but i dont want to get into detail of why that is. She survived. I was there for her. I took all my years vacation to be there for her. 

6 Months later i live with my parents again since i was breaking down and wasnt able to take care of myself anymore. i admit myself to a mental hospital because i was highly suicidal and L urged me to do it. After i admitted myself L blocked me on all social media up to this day. This was 3 years ago. I stayed 3 months in the hospital and learned alot. I learned that i suffer from depression, paranoia, narcissm, have borderline personality disorder and have symptoms that might be a psychosis but no one can confirm or deny this. I was talking about all the stuff that happened to me. But i learned nothing to cope with that stuff. Or accept it. Or stop thinking about it constantly. 

Basically i was worse than before. Everything was fresh in my mind. But no one taught me how to deal with that stuff. But hospital said i was ""healed"".

I moved out from my parents again and got a job in a callcenter since that was the only thing available in my hometown. I got minimum wage, had to have crazy amounts of knowledge, had extreme stats i had to reach or i was laid off and i hated every second. I was sick alot. Like ALOT. Every 2-3 weeks i had something. From colds, flu, migrane etc.

I stayed for a whole year. Eventho i was sick often i had exceptional stats. 99% customer satisfaction with extremely low talk time etc. Then i quit. I couldnt take it anymore. The constant pressure. Knowing that i will never be promoted no matter how good i am. Constant stuggle with money. I was miserable.

So i went into a different mental hospital. Did dialectic behavioural therapy instead of trauma therapy. Learned to use skills. Which is basically just finding something to occupy your brain so you stop thinking your sick sad thoughts. Does it solve anything? No, not at all. Do i feel better? No.

In therapy i found a girlfriend. She is perfect. She talks with me. She is understanding. But im struggling so hard since i have this paranoia that literally any person on this planet is just trying to hurt me. I trust her. I know that my thoughts are not real. But it hurts so fucking much. Just a few days ago she got her period. Almost 2 weeks earlier than expected. My thought process to this situation was. ""Well she was partying with her friends last weekend. She probably fucked a dude there, got Plan-B and one the side effects is that your period might come earlier or later than expected."" Like what the hell? How do you even come up with something like that? I feels like i just want to hurt myself. I should be happy. She is doing everything she can. And i cant appreciate it since my mind is just thinking up storys to hurt me. This literally makes me feel like im insane. Why would i do that to me?

Now im unemployed. Get my money from health insurance. Well for the next week that is. My psychiatrist told me that he wont be writing me sick any longer. He gave me no reason why he wont continue since he is 100% aware of my mental state. That means i dont get any money from my health insurance anymore since they think im healthy. Which means i have to get money from the state for being umemployed. Getting money from the state in my country means that you are required to apply for jobs. For ANY job that the state choses for you. If you dont apply (and show up to interviews or decline a job offer) they wont give you money. Like literally 0.

I cant work. I cant even apply for a job. Im not even able to keep my small flat clean or keep care of myself.

I want to quit but I know that would be selfish. Whenever iâ€™m feeling suicidal I always think about my birds, my dogs, my cat. Every morning my puppy greets me when i wake up. What would happen if one day i just didnâ€™t come out of my room? I feel so helpless. Iâ€™m stuck in a cycle of wanting to fucking kill myself, but realize I cant.

Tonight I wanna end it all,"It all started 2 years ago when on my 15th birthday my friend gifted me a video game called CSGO and I though it was gonna be the best thing ever as I was new to gaming. Then I met a guy from the UK by the name Nukes on steam ( a gaming platform) and he was good friends with me for a year we used to play sometimes and chit chat about csgo trading and stuff. And then my next birthday I decided to buying a $100 steam wallet code with all my saving of past year + birthday money ( its a big deal for me as I dont have a job yet student nor rich) and Nukes told me his ideas and how it would be great if I could send it to him and he could get me profit from trading items in the game ( he was on steam for 3-4 years already) so like any innocent person I went with it. Then it started. Me finding out he lied to me and started blackmailing me, acting racist to me, forcing me to do stuff like shaving my eveybrows and calling his friend the n word on tape if I wanted my money back, I was naive and though if this is how I could get my money back it wont be a big deal. It went on from there, he moved on to asking my socials and always under the pretext one last thing you need to do, I was getting severely cyber bullied and abused day and night but didn't tell anyone and use to cry everyday at night. He even went on stalk my youtube channel make more false promises, message my real life friends when I tried to block him and lure me back.

I lost my relationship with a wondeful person who I treated terribly, my home, my family, my friends, my job, my car, EVERYTHING. Everything I owned was in my car and it got towed while I was living in that car just trying to get back on my feet. And I can't afford to get my car back. Now I'm on the streets and I have no one. Not even my family wants to help anymore. And who can blame them? I have been nothing but a complete disappointment to everyone who has ever had love for and showed me kindness. I have hurt and betrayed everyone in my life. I even did an analysis of my life last night and I realized that I have NEVER succeeded in ANYTHING. I have failed at absolutely everything in my life.

It'll be so that the sand covers my body to be seen nevermore

Perhaps outside of the caves

To refrain from having my spirit be alone in the dark

Maybe I'll see stars

Maybe I'll see the moon

Quite a lot of suicidal thoughts lately....,"So this is getting straight out of fucking hand. I'm a young male, studying and I feel like whatever's this feeling (Anxiety? Depression? Stress? I have no fucking clue!) Is catching up with me. Now: supposedly I have a loving family, friends.... All that shit you already know. But I don't want to talk to them, not even my gf, in whom I'd trust almost anything. Grades are fucking reverse skyrocketing. I CAN'T get myself to sit down and study shit. I'm probably going to fail music, even although I have been taught music in a music school for about 7 years. I just don't understand some subjects and probably won't at all. Worst part is we are having a trip to Ireland before the summer break, and you are automatically chosen out if you fail 2 or more subjects. I will probably fail French, Music, Spanish, Math, and most likely Physics and chemistry. Now, of all of those I just used to struggle with math BTW.

So just recently I've started cutting myself again. Not serious wounds straight in the veins. But cuts in my left hand and arm which stay there for quite a while. I will most likely continue doing so as my grades keep coming in. I will most likely get any source of music taken away from me (PC, Mp3, Phone....) And this won't help at all with the situation. 

Also recently I started going out with a girl I liked since 2-3 years ago, and she has liked me for the same time. This is the first relationship for both of us. None of us has ever kissed, made out with anyone, etc. And we are both really shy. And I have had friends since the start of the relationship (We've been together for 3 months now) trying to pressure both of us into making out. I, as the coward I am, obviously couldn't make it happen despite her FUCKING TELLING ME SHE WANTS TO. 

And I've also had quite a high number of suicidal thoughts lately. Mostly think of how could I do it...
Think of hanging myself, OD to death, find a gun somewhere (not common at all in my country) and blow my head off, cut myself, tie a rope around my neck and stretch it so hard I die, sealing my swimming pool while turning on the water for it to slowly rise and drown me, put a toaster with me in the bath.... I'm quite creative, really....

Also I've been finding it hard to find reasons to stay alive. I feel like a burden for my GF and family, only see myself as a weight they must lift to carry on and never, ever, feel like doing something useful that someone would be thankful for.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fcvamc/quite_a_lot_of_suicidal_thoughts_lately/
Help.,"I wake up every morning not wanting to exist. My dad died last month and now I canâ€™t get these thoughts out of my head. He had been depressed for a long time and we often talked about mental health with each other. His mother had committed suicide via overdose when he was quite young. He died of natural causes in his sleep, and I just want to join him. I want to find the power to continue living but every day is a battle and I just donâ€™t know how to cope anymore. My thoughts have been getting darker and darker by the day and Iâ€™m beginning to fear myself.

The sad truth. My first post and my last post,"Firstly English is not my first language it my third actually so if there an error no it not because it my third language Iâ€™m just dumb 

Anyway Iâ€™m here to say well u people already seen it all in this sub or if u been around depression a lot stuff like what the point of living ? Why canâ€™t I find happiness ? Why should I endure the pain the pain of living in this society the pain of living in a shitty family the pain of life itself think about it we come in to this world bloody and crying is it a way for baby begging not to be born? If u believe in incarnation it actually make sense right? I just been thinking a lot 

The sad truth is half of the people on this sub that giving advice to people who about to give up is just on the high of depression right now what I mean is u like all of us here been dealing with depression and maybe u getting better or u think this time it ganna be different maybe this is last time Iâ€™m feeling better right 
Iâ€™m in the high right now I see hope!!! well here the sad truth all of u ganna RELAPSE like everytime some of u notice it and try to stop the depression some of u donâ€™t and go down to the devil we called depression even deeper it just a constant battle it just kinda funny to me that people giving advice in a few months they be here waiting for advice cos they relapse

All of this is my final thought this will just get lost in thousands of post here Iâ€™m about to turn 20 in a few months ganna do it before 20 I will plan it precisely and as perfect as possible the place to do it the material cut off all my connections deleted all my social media burn my phone and ID be on drug or heavily on alcohol to make my body weaker to fight my survival instinct that will get in the way I watch countless suicide video fail to learn the mistake they make so I will not fail

Everything is falling apart,"I've already had a lot going on in my personal life, and I was closer to suicide than I'd ever been. Then there was a huge argument among my friends. I won't get into details, but I don't think they'll make up. I was right in the middle and now I need to fucking pick a side. But I don't want to pick a side. If I do I'll lose some of my friends, and I am neutral on the whole situation anyway. If I don't pick a side, I'll start spending more time with one group than the other because I hate changing things, and then they'll hate me. So I'm going to isolate. I won't sit with them in the morning or at lunch, I'll only work with them in class if they come to me, etc. If they want to talk to me they'll find me. I don't have any other friends, so I'll be completely alone. Of course, that'll only happen if I don't end up killing myself before the end of March break. I was so close to suicide before the argument, but now I'm pushed past my limit. I'll probably go for the next opportunity I get (i.e. know I'll be home alone for 2+ hours). I just can't take this anymore, it's all become too much. I don't really want to die, but nothing ever gets better so what's the point.

"I feel so hopeless at this point, I want to be encouraged to end my misery","I'm 49, single and still a virgin believe it or not.

Religion,  Neuroticism , introversion, possible aspergers etc. It is not a simple problem.

I'm a guy. Today is my bday.I bought a can of chlorinated brake cleaner and want to hit it with a welder. That is pretty much what they used in WWI to wipe out the trenches. You smell a fresh cut lawn and a day later you are in a great place. I don't care if I suffer a bit but it is a 100% kill rate. Every single day is suffering for me.

No, I'm not some 19 yo writing this. They have their whole life ahead of them.

Now, it is not like I went out without a fight. In the last few years I watched every self help video. Most were aimed at young guys probably.

I bought clothes.

I have cool hobbies. I work on cars. I fix houses. I like to cook.

I work out. I run and rollerblade - 25 miles is not a problem - I don't even get out of breath. I'm still skinny though and built almost like a teenager. I tried to build muscle but I can't. Men my age look ""substantial."" My neighbor is my age EASILY twice my size. I look at men and I see their wrists and bones, I'm built like a woman. There is something unfixably wrong with me.

I feel like I'm dead and invisible to women. People my age are married with kids and enjoying life. I die inside when I see couples. I missed out on so much in life.  No one even wishes me happy birthday. It is hard to understand what truly being alone is like. It is like death in a way.

I'll never have kids or a family at this point. I just don't want to be the creepy old single man.

I have a computer company and make mid 6 figures, but it brings me zero joy. I'm not trying to brag, and I know other people struggle financially and feel bad but would you want to sit ALONE in front of 4 monitors for 12 hrs a day to make this money? I don't hate the work but why do it if I have no one to share it with?? I feel so alone, like I'm working from hell. I guess people benefit from my work indirectly thru the taxes I pay and the welfare and SNAP they get.

I just need the courage to empty this can and light up the contents. I'll finally be at peace. There is nothing at this point that will make me get better.

Yes I know suicide is the  easy way out to a temporary problem.  But in my life today  its no longer temporary. It feels that I can no longer feel myself to be alive anymore...  This is not my 1st rodeo but I did try to end my life over 10 years ago and wish I never survived it but I did and I am here again today thinking that, the feelings I am feeling is  to much for one person to take on every day every second and mostly every breath I take...

There are days I want to end my life and finding a way to end it, but I am a POS for not following threw any of. When I go to bed i say a prayer...   I now go to sleep, my lord my soul for you to keep,  as I don't need to wake in the morning so please take my life and let me rest in peace in my sleep, praise to you my lord my savoir, take my life , take my soul and take away the pain i am living as the pain to live is to much for me to take everyday to wear a fake smile.

From the moment I was born I had heart issueâ€™s and growing up I had a growth deficiency, to then my ribs growing in words and crushing my lungâ€™s along with asthma. Thatâ€™s just a small portion but it sums it up. From losing my dad at 15 when I finally was at an age to do thingâ€™s he liked which I developed a love for because I got to hangout with him, to then never being able to do them again and having to retire from hockey and sports because my lungs are so small due to my chest issues. Everyone left, I had nobody when I lost my dad, I spent years silent, didnâ€™t talk to anyone, same racial expression everyday. I dragged myself out of the hole, then life continues and people keep coming and going and destroying me on the way out with friends betraying me and relationships being cheated on. Iâ€™ve never been good enough for anyone. My mother doesnâ€™t speak to me anymore, sheâ€™ll go through my siblings to contact me. She also moved across the usa. Finally Iâ€™ve hit a point where I just donâ€™t want to keep praying for better dayâ€˜s. Itâ€™s been 6 years of in and out of hospitals for mental issues and thingâ€™s just never get better. I then lost my best friends dad from cancer whose family took me in when I was on the brink of ending it all and they helped me get better and it worked until my previous relationship. I mean I was happy again. Like I felt normal. I wasnâ€™t crying every morning and every night. I was excited for the day. But itâ€™s been about 9 months since that and Iâ€™ve cut the world off and I havenâ€™t spoke to anyone in weekâ€™s bc nobody ever tried to contact me and it was always me reaching out so I stop tried.

So sick of being so lonely,"I just don't know how to be normal anymore. The littlest things can set me off. I'm always hurting peoples feelings with jokes I make, then I always say ""Don't be so sensitive"" when I know for sure it was MY fault they got offended. It's hard for me to take responsibility.

I also feel very alone, and I don't mean the sense of friendships. I'm talking about romantic relationships. I've had about 4 or 5 concussions, and I say that because I know I've definitely had some that weren't diagnosed as I used to box. It's just really hard for me to say what I want to say. I fumble my words a lot, and I noticed that after my most recent concussion about a month ago.

For example, one thing I said that I regret was calling a girl a ""dyke"" because she said something rude to me. What I said was so uncalled for, especially since I knew she was bisexual. I feel like trash because I don't say things like this (homophobic) all the time per-say, but that is just an example of how offensive and unregulated the stuff that comes out of my mouth on the daily.

I constantly have to be high on marijuana most of the time to keep my mood up and I don't want to be like that. The weed just makes things worse for me when I'm not high because I get even more irritable then I was before I smoked and I go through bad anxiety and psychosis episodes.

I also feel like a failure. I am in my senior year of high school and I feel hopeless. My grades are all F's and I don't know what to do anymore. I plan on going to trade school after this year but I probably won't follow through on that because I never follow through on anything I want to do,  as my anxiety prevents me from doing lots of stuff.

I think about suicide but the thought scares me and it's just and endless cycle of just that and it sends me down a dark hole in my thoughts. I feel hopeless like nothing can help me anymore.

Also, I don't want to sound pathetic but its what I am. I told the girl I like that I liked her. She said doesn't reciprocate those feelings but it hurt when she said she liked me 2 years prior. It especially hurt because I liked her back then as well. Once again my anxiety prevents me from being happy and thats all I want, is too be happy again.

Regardless, I've been feeling this way for awhile now, and I cant handle it much longer. I've tried to be strong, but I'm weakening everyday. My parents wont care, they'd be better off without me. I'm an average student but I'm never good enough. I love art but they dont understand. They want me to be a rich doctor. That wont happen. My only talent is art, and that's it - I know it wont get me anywhere. I do nothing but disgust and disappoint. I really wish I was aborted, never born. I'm a burden, and my parents refuse therapy because it costs money and all they care about is money and my grades. They as well dont believe in mental issues.
I've always been too much of a pussy to consider hurting myself, let alone, ending myself. I know I wont have a future, so why bother with going onward? I'm banal, a dead weight. I've done nothing remarkable nor contributable. If I do kill myself my parents will blame it on 'the liberal school system brainwashing me' or some shit. I just want everything to go numb forever.

i feel like im the hostage of myself,"i dont know but im trying to live life normally and all but there's always this 'voice' or these thoughts that keeps me pushing away from the good things, i just cant accept to try my best for myself. i need to stop what i like doing, ignore persons and all just because of that 'voice' in my head that keeps pushing me down. i've really been feeling down and down and down, all i see is dark, my entire universe is black, there's no light.. every time i find a sparkle it fades away so fast. I just ask for one thing: i want to die.

im the kind of person that cant say no, and try my best to help everyone and to look nice to everyone but i feel so lost inside, i cant make choices. im just doing what that 'voice' keeps telling me but everytime i feel like im getting lower and lower. i've already planned everything for my suicide and if things wont get better, ill just do it. i have nothing to lose. 

sometimes i wish i could have a soul I can ally with to beat that voice... im just lost. i wish maybe something could help me, anyone... help me make decisions. idk i've always been so lonely, and i have big problems socializing because of this 'voice', i might have friends that love me but i feel like im just nothing, and THAT 'voice' just keeps pushing me away from them and from everyone. i try to make new friends, meet lots of people but in the end i feel bad and i end up ignoring everyone and staying hostage of that 'voice'.... i dont get it because when im with people and all i dont seem to be strange or anything i try to tell things so people notice i have problems but in the end im just closing myself with my own thoughts and cant seem to try anything to beat myself on my own game....

Ran out of people to turn to,"I'm 9 years post the hospitalizations/drug guinea pig era and all the bullshit that comes from not having enough money or insurance to afford professionals that won't prescribe you Jesus or tell you withdrawals don't exist and it's purely psychological. Like, to summarize. I'm 24 now and have managed a normal and social life at school and my restaurant jobs when almost 10 years ago just the thought of leaving my house would give me severe panic attacks. Took a long ass time to fix. I got fit and cute and all that and did the [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) things and socialized with errybody like I learned on the internet and stuff.

A year and a half ago my father suddenly gave me a deadline to leave our apartment. Then pushed it earlier and changed the locks while I was crashing somewhere else. He eventually confessed he's uncomfortable having me in his home because of what I went through and just can't have me around anymore. It's insanely fucked up to have that thrown in your face and then some. ""Our"" became his and everything else his wife's.

When I became homeless periodically this past year, none of my friends or family and family friends helped me when I asked or begged. My relatives cut contact again and most of my friends and people I knew never got back to me while others awkwardly explained how we can't be friends anymore. Even people who knew me personally and what I had gone through just stopped responding to me. In person it was this strange distance from them like I'm a stranger to them. I guess reality started unfolding when things got real. You see your true friends when your heart really needs them.

Unfortunately I had a mental break at work during all this and panicked the fuck out into a depression storm and smashed a glass to use on myself in the back of my restaurant. Everyone was supportive that night and my manager got me in contact with the company's employee support fund stuff to put together money for a deposit for a place and anxiety accommodations at work. The next shifts everybody working there behaved as if I wasn't in the same room and would avoid interacting with me. I was fired a few days later and HR did absolutely nothing. I loved that place and made good money but fucked it up in a snap.

I've been homeless on and off and I couldn't get into any shelters with welfare vouchers or go on SNAP/Section 8, etc because I'm one of those DACA people. The good shelters were always full and the social workers would tell me if I know somewhere I can sleep safe, it's better to do that than the overpopulated homeless shelters here in the NY/NJ metro area. So I'd hide in people's backyards and in abandoned buildings in richer towns at night and hang around parks/libraries during the day. My dad offered to pay rent for my own place for now after he found me sleeping in his garage in 15 degree weather thank fuck for that.

Dozens of online job apps and irl job apps done and still nothing. Then the thoughts come over and over and I don't know what to do. Prozac makes me act on the thoughts while no prozac makes me tolerate them in a panic. I stay off it and just tolerate panicking and crying it away. I can't afford school and my own place while working full-time and don't have enough money to renew my DACA. Future is fucked up. The one support I got doesn't wanna talk to me and pays to keep me away. Oof. My mind calmed down after turning this into a vent..

I really fucked up,"I messed up. I screwed up the trust I've built with my boyfriend who has paranoia.

My entire life I was afraid of confronting people. I got it from my parents. I would either get yelled at asking for help or they would help. It scared me that I couldn't confront normally as anyone else would. My boyfriend had problems carrying from toxic relationships he's had and I felt like he was bringing it into ours. I wanted to help him but instead of confronting him first I confronted a friend and told them what was up. The promises I've made to him, broken. I wanted to help him first and I felt that it was necessary. Then, because of all of this, my best friend and he argued and argued and they broke off, a lot of details here are not added because it's personal but I just felt like I'm at the bottom of the food chain. Why be here if I just destroy everything. I broke the trust I've built into him, I ruined a friendship I've had and one of the ones my boyfriend had. I feel like I just don't deserve to exist and I've always felt like that from all the mistakes I make. I just wanted to help but instead, I bring misery. I'm sorry for posting this and dabbling on but I felt like I needed to just choke something out because my heart just hurts from repeating the same thoughts in my head that I'm the worst and it would've been better if my suicide attempt two years ago worked.

Best caliber for suicide?,"Deciding I'm going to end my life and I want it to be as painless as possible. Please don't waste time trying to talk me out of it, I just feel life suicide should be everyones right. 

If I was shooting myself in the head, what caliber is best?

9mm, smaller. Better penetration, but maybe won't penetrate skull? 

.40, feeling like it's the best of both worlds between 9mm and .45, bigger and more power.

.45 bigger, but slower bullet, maybe won't penetrate skull either at point blank range. 

.357 sig, feeling like it should be either this or the .40, although my military friend says .40 sucks and 9mm is better than .40. 

What do you think? Been watching penetration videos on YouTube but obviously none of them are for a skullx or point blank.

Really don't want to end up in a hospital bed. Was planning on doing it at my temple but read there is no brain matter at the temple may not work.

If you try to get ""help"" and talk to someone about being suicidal in the US you're just apprehended by police, handcuffed, thrown in an ambulance, and shipped off to a psych ward where staff verbally and physically abuses you for the next 72 hours to 2 weeks. (At the youth psych ward by my house they put you in solitary confinement for CRYING). Then you get out feeling even more scared and hopeless, disgruntled with the world and sickened by the fact that this is the ""help"" out there. Then you get more suicidal because you were just abused for days on end and realize there's literally nothing you can do. So you'll get locked in the psych ward again, be treated like shit again, continue getting more depressed, angry, and resentful, rinse and repeat.

Imagine that you live in a world where you look to others the way you feel, and depending on how good you feel inside how good you appear to others. This is kind of real for hormones and these produce pheromones. Anyone can feel a certain way within, and this has a direct impact in others. Not only that, but the fact that most of the time you are not looking at yourself, the only thing you percieve of yourself is how you feel, so focus on just that.

I don't want to keep fighting. I just wish it would all end and I could have peace. All I ever asked for out of life was for love. All I ever wanted was love.

I'm too stupid to achieve anything in life. I'm thinking of taking my life tomorrow night.,"I have a low IQ. Twice I've been tested and both times I got an IQ around 84-85. Somehow, I didn't do entirely awful in school, I was able to be a B student without much studying. When I actually started studying I started to get grades in the 90s and even some at 100%. Even though I skimmed through with exemplary grades, I barely retained any of what I learned. Nobody around me believes that I am stupid because of my grades, but that is all they go off of. I have a poor vocabulary overall, especially in spoken word, and I cannot do basic mental math. I still count with my fingers and I am nineteen years old. I am from a low income, uneducated family so I was innately disadvantaged from birth, also with having my mom smoke weed and cigarettes throughout her pregnancy with me. During the 8th month of her pregnancy I detached from the placenta and they had to preform an emergency c-section. It is very likely that I have brain damage from oxygen deprivation. 

 I just feel incredibly empty every moment I am awake. My favorite time of the day is when I go to sleep at night, but night always goes by too quickly. Lately I've been spending everyday sleeping because I have much more joy in my dreams. I just want at least an average intelligence, at least. It is unbearable being aware every moment that I am dumb and will only ever be dumb. I have always aspired to leave the financial hole, but everyday that passes reminds me that it will probably never happen. At this point I feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place, because I am terrified to leave behind my family and my pets, but I know if I continue living my life will only get worse and worse. Please, if anyone could give me even just a smidgen of hope I will be greatly appreciative.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fcm96q/im_too_stupid_to_achieve_anything_in_life_im/

Halloween at a Hospital.,"An extremely modest man was in the hospital for a series of tests, the last of which had left his bodily systems extremely upset.

Upon making several false alarm trips to the bathroom, he decided the latest episode was another and stayed put.

He suddenly filled his bed with diarrhea and was embarrassed beyond his ability to remain rational.

In a complete loss of composure he jumped out of bed, gathered up the bed sheets, and threw them out the hospital window.

A drunk was walking by the hospital when the sheets landed on him.

He started yelling, cursing, and swinging his arms violently trying to get the unknown things off, and ended up with the soiled sheets in a tangled pile at his feet.

As the drunk stood there, unsteady on his feet, staring down at the sheets, a hospital security guard, (barely containing his laughter), and who had watched the whole incident, walked up and asked, ""What the heck is going on here?""

The drunk, still staring down replied: ""I think I just beat the shit out of a ghost.""",0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1809fc/halloween_at_a_hospital/

The barman notices them staring and says,""That's Tiny guys. He's reeeeeeaaaallll sensitive about the whole missing nose business.""

OLD AGE AND TREACHERY WILL OVERCOME YOUTH AND SKILL EVERY TIME!,"A father, son and grandson went to the country club for their weekly round of golf. Just as they reached the first tee, a beautiful young blond woman carrying her bag of clubs approached them.

She explained that the member who brought her to the club for a round of golf had an emergency that called him away and asked the trio whether she could join them.

Naturally, the guys all agreed.

Smiling, the blonde thanked them and said, 'Look, fellows, I work in a topless bar as a dancer, so nothing shocks me anymore. If any of you want to smoke cigars, have a beer, bet, swear, tell off-color stories or do anything that you normally do when playing a round together, go ahead. But, I enjoy playing golf, consider myself pretty good at it, so don't try to coach me on how to play my shots.'

With that the guys agreed to relax and invited her to drive first.

All eyes were fastened on her shapely behind as she bent to place her ball on the tee. She then took her driver and hit the ball 270 yards down the middle, right in front of the green.

The father's mouth was agape. 'That was beautiful,' he said.

The blonde put her driver away and said, 'I really didn't get into it, and I faded it a little.'

After the three guys hit their drives and their second shots, the blonde took out an eight iron and lofted the ball within five feet of the hole. (She was closest to the pin.)

The son said, 'Damn, lady, you played that perfectly.'

The blonde frowned and said, 'It was a little weak, but even an easy seven would have been too much club. I've left a tricky little putt.' She then tapped in the five-footer for a birdie.

Having the honors, she drove first on the second hole, knocked the heck out of the ball, and it landed nearly 300 yards away smack in the middle of the fairway.

For the rest of the round the statuesque blonde continued to amaze the guys, quietly and methodically shooting for par or less on every hole.

When they arrived at the 18th green, the blond was three under par, and had a very nasty 
12-foot putt on an undulating green for a par.

She turned to the three guys and said, 'I really want to thank you all for not acting like a bunch of chauvinists and telling me what club to use or how to play a shot, but I need this putt for a 69 and I'd really like to break 70 on this course.

If any one of you can tell me how to make par on this hole I'll take him back to my apartment, pour some 35-year-old Single Malt Strath Mill Scotch in him, fix him a steak dinner and then show him a very good time the rest of the night.'

The yuppie son jumped at the thought! He strolled across the green, carefully eyeing the line of the putt and finally said, 'Honey, aim about 6 inches to the right of the hole and hit it firm. It will get over that little hump and break right into the cup.'

The father knelt down and sighted the putt using his putter as a plumb. 'Don't listen to the kid, darlin', you want to hit it softly 10 inches to the right and let it run left down that little hogback, so it falls into the cup.'

The old gray-haired grandfather walked over to the blonde's ball, picked it up and handed it to her and said, 'That's a gimme, sweetheart.' The blonde smiled and said, 'Your car or mine?'",0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/16r5ub/old_age_and_treachery_will_overcome_youth_and/

Baby Confusion,"An English, a Pakistani, and an Irish couple all simultaneously arrive at a hospital, all of the wives in the couple going into labour at approximately the same time. All of the babies were delivered healthily after fairly routine births but unfortunately, after placing the babies in their cradles, the nurse realized that she had forgotten to place tags on the different sheets. She informed the doctor of her mistake and that she was unable to recall which baby was which. The doctor was something of a scientist and believed that there was a parenting instinct which would allow them to identify the babies. He said they would let the couples go in, look at the babies, and take whichever one they identified as their own through this inherent, natural drive.

The English couple went first, returning almost immediately carrying the darkest skinned child. The nurse, recognizing this, approached the English couple to inform them;.

"Why men don't write advice columns...
","Dear Walter,


I hope you can help me here. The other day, I set off for work leaving my husband in the house watching the TV as usual. I hadn't driven more than a mile down the road when the engine conked out and the car shuddered to a halt. I walked back home to get my husband's help.

When I got home I couldn't believe my eyes. He was in our bedroom with the neighbours daughter. I am 32, my husband is 34, and the neighbours daughter is 22. We have been married for ten years. When I confronted him, he broke down and admitted that they had been having an affair for the past 
six months.

I told him to stop or I would leave him. He was sacked from his job six months ago and he says he has been feeling increasingly depressed and worthless. I love him very much, but ever since I gave him the ultimatum he has become increasingly distant. He won't go to counselling and I'm afraid I can't get through to him anymore.

Can you please help?

Sincerely, Sheila

-------------------------------


Dear Sheila:

A car stalling after being driven a short distance can be caused by a variety of faults with the engine. Start by checking that there is no dirt in the fuel line. If it is clear, check the vacuum pipes and hoses on the intake manifold and also check all grounding wires. If none of these approaches solves the problem, it could be that the fuel pump itself is faulty, causing low delivery pressure to the injectors.

I hope this helps.

"Three men, a philosopher, a mathematician and an idiot, were out riding in the car when it crashed into a tree.","Three men, a philosopher, a mathematician and an idiot, were out riding in the car when it crashed into a tree. Before anyone knows it, the three men found themselves standing before the pearly gates of Heaven, where St. Peter and the Devil were standing nearby.
""Gentlemen,"" the Devil started, ""Due to the fact that Heaven is now overcrowded, St. Peter has agreed to limit the number of people entering Heaven. If anyone of you can ask me a question which I don't know or cannot answer,then you're worthy enough to go to Heaven; if not, then you'll come with me to Hell.""
The philosopher then stepped up,""OK, give me the most comprehensive report on Socrates' Socrates' teachings."" With a snap of his finger, a stack of paper appeared next to the Devil. The philosopher read it and concluded it was correct. ""Then, go to Hell!"" With another snap of his finger, the philsopher disappeared.
The mathematician then asked,""Give me the most complicated formula ever theorized!"" With a snap of his finger, another stack of paper appeared next to the Devil. The mathematician read it and reluctantly agreed it was correct.""Then, go to Hell!"" With another snap of his finger, the mathematician disappeared too.
The idiot then stepped forward and said, ""Bring me a chair!"" The Devil brought forward a chair. ""Drill 7 holes on the seat."" The Devil did just that. The idiot then sat on the chair and let out a very loud fart. Standing up, he asked, ""Which hole did my fart come out from?"" The Devil inspected the seat and said,""The third hole from the right.""""Wrong,"" said the idiot, ""it's from my asshole.""

A Classic!,"A ten-year-old boy was failing math. His parents tried everything from tutors to hypnosis, but to no avail. Finally, at the insistence of a family friend, they decided to enroll their son in a private Catholic school. 

After the first day, the boy's parents were surprised when he walked in after school with a stern, focused and very determined expression on his face, and went right past them straight to his room, where he quietly closed the door. For nearly two hours he toiled away in his room - with math books strewn about his desk and the surrounding floor. He emerged long enough to eat, and after quickly cleaning his plate, went straight back to his room, closed the door, and worked feverishly at his studies until bedtime.

Overjoyed, she and her husband rushed into their son's room, thrilled at his remarkable progress. ""Was it the nuns that did it?,"" the father asked. The boy only shook his head and said, ""No."" ""Was it the one-on-one tutoring? The peer-mentoring?"" ""No."" ""The textbooks? The teachers? The curriculum?"" 

""Nope,"" said the son. ""On that first day, when I walked in the front door and saw that guy they nailed to the 'plus sign,' I just knew they meant business!""

Panicking, the other guy runs up to a caretaker and cries out for help. The caretaker asks him: ""Which of these pythons ate your friend, the male or the female one?""

How To Get Hired At Walmart,"

A manager at Wal-Mart had the task of hiring someone to fill a job opening. After sorting through a stack of resumes he found four people who were equally qualified. He decided to call the four in and ask them only one question. Their answer would determine which of them would get the job.

The day came and as the four sat around the conference room table, the interviewer asked, 'What is the fastest thing you know of?'

The first man replied, 'A THOUGHT.' It just pops into your head. There's no warning.

'That's very good!' replied the interviewer. 'And, now you sir?', he asked the second man.

'Hmmm...let me see 'A blink! It comes and goes and you don't know that it ever happened. A BLINK is the fastest thing I know of.'

'Excellent!' said the interviewer. 'The blink of an eye, that's a very popular clichÃ© for speed.' He then turned to the third man, who was contemplating his reply.

'Well, out at my dad's ranch, you step out of the house and on the wall there's a light switch. When you flip that switch, way out across the pasture the light on the barn comes on in less than an instant. 'Yep, TURNING ON A LIGHT is the fastest thing I can think of'.

The interviewer was very impressed with the third answer and thought he had found his man. 'It's hard to beat the speed of light,' he said.

Turning to BUBBA, the fourth and final man, the interviewer posed the same question.

Old Bubba replied, 'After hearing the previous three answers, it's obvious to me that the fastest thing known is DIARRHEA.'

'WHAT!?' said the interviewer, stunned by the response.

'Oh sure', said BUBBA. 'You see, the other day I wasn't feeling so good, and I ran for the bathroom, but before I could THINK, BLINK, or TURN ON THE LIGHT, I had already s**t my pants.'

BUBBA is now the new greeter at a Wal-Mart near you!

When Engineers go to hell...,"An engineer dies and reports to the Pearly Gates. Saint Peter checks his dossier and, not seeing his name there, accidentally sends him to Hell.

One fine day in Ireland, a guy is out golfing and gets up to the 16th hole. He tees up and cranks one. Unfortunately, it goes into the woods on the side of the fairway.


He goes looking for his ball and comes across this little guy with this huge knot on his head, and the golf ball lying right beside him. ""Goodness,"" says the golfer, and proceeds to revive the poor little guy.


Upon awaking, the little guy says, ""Well, you caught me fair and square. I am a leprechaun. I will grant you three wishes.""


The man says, ""I can't take anything from you, I""m just glad I didn""t hurt you too badly,"" and walks away.

The leprechaun says, ""I'm fine, and might I ask how your golf game is?""


The golfer says, ""It's great! I hit under par every time.""


The leprechaun says, ""I did that for you. And might I ask how your money is holding out?""


The golfer says, ""Well, now that you mention it, every time I put my hand in my pocket, I pull out a ten pound note.""


The leprechaun smiles and says, ""I did that for you. And might I ask how your sex life is?""


The golfer looks at him a little shyly and says, ""Well, maybe once or twice a week.""


The leprechaun is floored and stammers, ""Once or twice a week?!""


The golfer, a little embarrassed, looks at him and says, ""Well, that's not too bad for a Catholic priest in a small parish.""

""There ain't no way they can catch a Corvette,"" he thought to himself and opened her up further. The needle hit 90, 100, 130 and finally 150 with the light still behind him. ""What the hell am I doing?"" he thought and pulled over.


The cop came up to him, took his license without a word and examined it and the car. ""I've had a tough shift and this is my last pull over. I don't feel like more paperwork so if you can give me an excuse for your driving that I haven't heard before you can go!""


""Last week my wife ran off with a cop,"" the man said, ""and I was afraid you were trying to give her back!""


""Off you go,"" said the officer.

A driver is pulled over by a police man.


Man: Is there a problem Officer?


Officer: Sir, you were speeding.


Man: Oh I see.


Officer: Can I see your licence please?


Man: I'd give it to you but I don't have one.


Officer: Don't have one?


Man: Lost it four times for drink driving.


Officer: I see, can I see your vehicle registration papers please?


Man: I can't do that.


Officer: Why not?


Man: I stole this car.


Officer: Stole it?


Man: Yes, and I raped and killed the owner.


Officer: You what?


Man: She's in the boot if you want to see.


The Officer looks at the man and slowly backs away to his car and calls for back up. Within minutes five police cars circle the car. A senior officer slowly approaches the car, clasping his half drawn gun.


Officer #2: Sir, could you step out of your vehicle please! The man steps out of his vehicle.


Man: Is there a problem sir?


Officer #2: One of my officers told me that you have stolen this car and murdered the owner.


Man: Murdered the owner?


Officer #2: Yes, could you please open the boot of your car please.


The man opens the boot, revealing nothing but an empty boot.


Officer #2: Is this your car sir?


Man: Yes, here are the registration papers.


The officer is quite stunned.


Officer #2: One of my officers claims that you do not have a driving licence.


The man digs in his pocket revealing a wallet and hands it to the officer. The officer opens the wallet and examines the licence. He looks quite puzzled.


Officer #2: Thank you sir, one of my officers told me you didn't have a licence, stole this car, raped and murdered the owner.


Man: I bet you the lying bastard told you I was speeding, too.

Little Johnny is constantly late for school and what's worse is that he always has a big lie explaining why. The teacher tells the principal that she has had it with his exaggerations. The principal tells her to send Johnny to him the next time he shows up late. He will tell Johnny a lie so big that he will never tell another one. Ever.


The next day, Johnny shows up two hours late. Johnny says, ""I was two hours early today so I had time to fish in the pond on my way to school. I caught a 17-pound trout and had to take it home. If I didn't clean it and freeze it, my mom would've been angry. That's why I'm so late"".


The teacher promptly takes him to the principal's office and explains the story to the principal.


The principal tells Johnny about his own trip to school that day. He says, ""I was walking to school through the park on the trail today when I heard something behind me. I turned around and was shocked to see a giant grizzly bear behind me. He was 24 feet tall and had 6-inch fangs. He was going to eat me, Johnny! Just then a little dog ran out from the bushes, jumped up and attacked the bear. The little dog killed the bear and then ate the whole bear right there in front of me. What do you think of that, Johnny?""


Johnny replies, ""Oh yeah, that's my dog Sparky. That's his third bear this week.""

A defendant was on trial for murder in Philadelphia. There was strong evidence indicating guilt, but there was no corpse. In the defenseâ€™s closing statement the lawyer, knowing that his client would probably be convicted, resorted to a trick.


""Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I have a surprise for you all,"" the lawyer said as he looked at his watch. ""Within one minute, the person presumed dead in this case will walk into this courtroom.""
He looked toward the courtroom door. The jurors, somewhat stunned, all looked on eagerly. A minute passed. Nothing happened.


Finally the lawyer said, ""Actually, I made up the previous statement. But you all looked on with anticipation. I, therefore, put it to you that there is reasonable doubt in this case as to whether anyone was killed and insist that you return a verdict of not guilty.""


The jury, clearly confused, retired to deliberate. A few minutes later, the jury returned and pronounced a verdict of guilty.


""But how?"" inquired the lawyer. ""You must have had some doubt; I saw all of you stare at the door.""
Answered the jury foreman: ""Oh, we did look. But your client didnâ€™t.""

He said he'd offer to provide her with free meat until the boy was 16. She agreed.


The butcher had been counting the years off on his calendar, and one day the teenager who had been collecting the meat each week, came into the shop and said, ""I'll be 16 tomorrow."" ""I know,"" said the butcher with a smile, ""I've been counting too, tell your mother, when you take this parcel of meat home, that it is the last free meat she'll get, and watch the expression on her face."" When the boy arrived home he told his mother.


The woman nodded and said, ""Son, go back to the butcher and tell him I have also had free bread, free milk, and free groceries for the last 16 years and watch the expression on his face!""

The young bride approached her awaiting husband on their wedding night and demanded $20 for their first love-making encounter. In his highly aroused state, he readily agreed.


This scenario was repeated each time they made love for the next 30 years, him thinking it was a cute way for her to buy new clothes, etc.


Arriving home around noon one day, she found her husband in a very drunken state. Over the next few minutes she heard of the ravages of financial ruin caused by corporate down sizing and it's effects on a 50 year old executive.


Calmly, she handed him a bank book showing deposits and interest for 12 years totaling nearly $1 million dollars. Pointing across the parking lot she gestured toward the local bank while handing him stock certificates worth nearly $2 million dollars and informing him that he was the largest stockholder in the bank. She told him that for 30 years she had charged him each time they had sex , and this was the result of her investments.


By now he was distraught and beating his head against the side of the car. She asked him why the disappointment at such good news and he replied, ""If I had known what you were doing, I would have given you all of my business!""

""Nothing,"" sighed the little guy despondently. ""You see, today has been the worst day of my life. This morning I overslept and was late for an important meeting.

So I got a taxi home, but when it came to paying the driver I realised I'd forgotten my wallet. I then had to go into my house but I found my wife in bed with the gardener. So I left home and came to this bar. And just when I was thinking about ending it all, you came along and drank my poison...""

First Time

================

The sky was dark

The moon was high

All alone just she and I

Her hair was soft

Her eyes were blue

I knew just what

She wanted to do

Her skin so soft

Her legs so fine

I ran my fingers

Down her spine

I didn't know how

But I tried my best

I started by placing

My hands on her breast

I remember my fear

My fast beating heart

But slowly she spread

Her legs apart

And when I did it

I felt no shame

All at once

The white stuff came

At last it's finished

It's all over now

My first time ever

At milking a cow...

A couple who drove their car to K-Mart only to have their car breakdown in the parking lot. The man told his wife to carry on with the shopping while he fixed the car.


The wife returned later to see a small group of people near the car. On closer inspection she saw a pair of male legs protruding from under the chassis. Although the man was in shorts, his lack of underpants turned private parts into glaringly public ones.


Unable to stand the embarrassment she dutifully stepped forward and tucked everything back into place.
On regaining her feet she looked across the hood and found herself staring at her husband who was standing idly by.


The mechanic, however, had to have three stitches in his head.

The Mafia was looking for a new man to make weekly collections from all the private businesses that they were ""protecting."" Feeling the heat from the police force, they decide to use a deaf and dumb person for this job. If he were to get caught, he wouldn't be able to communicate to the police what he was doing.


On his first week, the collector picks up over $40,000. He gets greedy, decides to keep the money and stashes it in a safe place. The Mafia soon realizes that their collection is late, and sends some of their hoods after the deaf and dumb collector.


The hoods find the collector and ask him where the money is. The deaf and dumb collector can't communicate with them, so the Mafia drags the guy to an interpreter.


The Mafia hood says to the interpreter, ""Ask him where da money is.""


The interpreter signs, ""Where's the money?""


The dumb man signs back, ""I don't know what you're talking about.""


The interpreter tells the hood, ""He says he doesn't know what you're talking about.""


The hood pulls out a .38 and places it in the ear of the dumb collector. ""Now ask him where the money is!""


The interpreter signs, ""Where is the money?


The deaf man signs back, ""The $40,000 is in a tree stump in Central Park.""


The interpreter says to the hood, ""He says he still doesn't know what you're talking about, and doesn't think you have the balls to pull the trigger.""

""Congratulations on overcoming temptation,"" says the pastor. ""Welcome to the church."" He then turns to the newlyweds and asks if they were able to abstain for two weeks.

Anger Management,"I was sitting at my desk when I remembered a phone call I'd forgotten to make. 

I found the number and dialed it. 

A man answered, saying 'Hello.' 

I politely said, 
'This is Chris. Could I please speak with Robyn Carter?' 

Suddenly a manic voice yelled out in my ear 
'Get the right f***ing number!' 
And the phone was slammed down on me. 

I couldn't believe that anyone could be so rude. 

When I tracked down Robyn's correct number to call her, 
I found that I had accidentally transposed the last two digits. 

After hanging up with her, I decided to call the 'wrong' number again. 

When the same guy answered the phone, I yelled 'You're an asshole!' 
And hung up. 

I wrote his number down with the word 'asshole' next to it, 
And put it in my desk drawer. 

Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills or had a really bad day, 
I'd call him up and yell, 'You're an asshole!' 

It always cheered me up. 

When Caller ID was introduced, I thought my therapeutic 'asshole' calling would have to stop. 

So, I called his number and said, 'Hi, this is John Smith from the telephone company. 
I'm calling to see if you're familiar with our Caller ID Program?' 

He yelled 'NO!' And slammed down the phone. 

I quickly called him back and said, 'That's because you're an asshole!' 
And hung up. 

One day I was at the store, getting ready to pull into a parking spot. 

Some guy in a black BMW cut me off and pulled into the spot I had patiently waited for. 

I hit the horn and yelled that I'd been waiting for that spot, but the idiot ignored me. 

I noticed a 'For Sale' sign in his back window, so I wrote down his number. 

A couple of days later, right after calling the first asshole (I had his number on speed dial) 
I thought that I'd better call the BMW asshole, too. 

I said, 'Is this the man with the black BMW for sale?' 

He said, 'Yes, it is.' 

I then asked, 'Can you tell me where I can see it?' 

He said, 'Yes, I live at 34 Oaktree Blvd. , in Fairfax 
It's a yellow ranch style house And the car's parked right out in front.' 

I asked, 'What's your name?' 

He said, 'My name is Don Hansen.' 

I asked, 'When's a good time to catch you, Don?' 

He said, 'I'm home every evening after five.' 

I said, 'Listen, Don, can I tell you something?' 

He said, 'Yes?' 

I said, 'Don, you're an asshole!' 

Then I hung up, and added his number to my speed dial, too. 

Now, when I had a problem, I had two assholes to call. 

Then I came up with an idea... 

I called asshole #1. 

He said, 'Hello' 

I said, 'You're an asshole!' 
(But I didn't hang up.) 

He asked, 'Are you still there?' 

I said, 'Yeah!' 

He screamed, 'Stop calling me' 

I said, 'Make me.' 

He asked, 'Who are you?' 

I said, 'My name is Don Hansen.' 

He said, 'Yeah? Where do you live?' 

I said, 'Asshole, I live at 34 Oaktree Blvd., in Fairfax, a yellow ranch style home and I have a black Beamer parked in front.' 

He said, 'I'm coming over right now, Don. 
And you had better start saying your prayers.' 

I said, 'Yeah, like I'm really scared, asshole,' and hung up. 

Then I called Asshole #2. 

He said, 'Hello?' 

I said, 'Hello, asshole,' 

He yelled, 'If I ever find out who you are...' 

I said, 'You'll what?' 

He exclaimed, 'I'll kick your ass' 

I answered, 'Well, asshole, here's your chance. 
I'm coming over right now.' 

Then I hung up and immediately called the police, saying that I was on my way over to 34 Oaktree Blvd, in Fairfax, to kill my gay lover. 

Then I called Channel 7 News about the gang war going down in Oaktree Blvd in Fairfax .
I quickly got into my car and headed over to Fairfax . 

I got there just in time to watch two assholes beating the crap out of each other in front of six cop cars, an overhead news helicopter and surrounded by a news crew. 

NOW I feel much better.

Golf with the boss,"A man and his boss skip work one weekday afternoon for a round of golf.  They tee off at 1:00 and after 2 holes they catch up to a twosome of women.  The women are playing unbearably slowly.

After waiting nearly an hour to play a hole, the men discuss how to get around these slow-playing women.  They try yelling to them, to no avail.

When the men reach the 4th tee, a par 3, they wait another 30 minutes while one of the girls takes 10 shots to get out of a sand trap.  The boss says to his subordinate, ""I'm going to take a ride up there in the cart and ask if we can play through.""

The boss gets about 50 yards from the green and abruptly turns around and drives back to the tee.  The subordinate asks, ""What happened?  Why didn't you say anything to them?""

The boss says, ""I got about 50-60 yards away, and I could tell that the two women were my wife and my mistress.""

The subordinate says, ""We ain't got all day.  Let me go talk with them.""  So he drives up, gets about 50 yards away, and abruptly turns around.

When he gets back to the tee, he says, ""Unbelievable.  What a fucking coincidence.""",0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/17agcg/golf_with_the_boss/

make wild passionate love to me on the tabletop. It was terrible!
