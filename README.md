Ada the Chatbot: you are loved.

Ada is a Reddit-based chatbot that uses machine learning to take a new approach to helping people with depression. When run, the program takes information from recent Reddit posts in certain subreddits and runs the contents through a machine learning model. It is able to then distinguish whether or not the post hints toward depression or suicidal thoughts. If a post shows signs that a user may be depressed, the chatbot replies to the post with gentle comments that may lift the user's mood.
